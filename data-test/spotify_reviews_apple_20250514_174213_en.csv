Johnny Sullivan,Nothing but ads now,This app used to be decent until the constant 1:30 - 3:00 ads that pop up every few songs. God forbid you try to skip a song. That's another ad. Spotify developers are intentionally doing this to try and push us to pay for premium. Might as well listen to the radio at this point.,1,9.0.40,2025-05-12T19:29:48-07:00,us,2025-05-14 17:42:13

bob (not bob,LOVE THIS APP!!!,"Ok I love Spotify and I prefer it over Apple Music. BUT, I do have a few things that I think need improvement. I don't have Spotify premium and I'm not saying allow certain things that you allow in premium, but things that premium also doesn't include. First, I hate how you can't search for songs in your library(or in playlists). Next, I hate how you can't play all your songs at once, like you can in Apple Music. The only reason I know this is because my family has a plan on Apple Music but I'm gonna start paying for Apple Music soon the only reason I haven't yet is bc I don't have a credit card yet(I'm 15). Lastly, and idk if this is just my phone, but sometimes when I'm on an ad, it won't let me get out of it. It won't let me look at my other playlists or search something or anything. So idk if that was intentional or not. That's all! Everything else is great and I loveeee this app! Idk what I would do without itüòÖ",5,9.0.40,2025-05-12T18:09:19-07:00,us,2025-05-14 17:42:13

Walk it off ho3,Lack of transparency,"It kinda bothers me that when i had downloaded this app again as i do every once and a while when i get offered a  deal on the subscription, i noticed that the UI that was present in first few minutes was nice and sleek more modern if you will and i liked it (aesthetically speaking) well in minutes i realized it reverted to the dull  basic UI and it was so off putting. I contacted Spotify and they told me to wait while they looked into it 3 times telling me thanks for your patience blah blah, after 15 minutes the message I received was ""we don't have any information to offer on this issue, thanks for contacting Spotify"" and they ended the chat‚Ä¶ Classic corporate runaround‚Äî""we're looking into it"" followed by radio silence and a generic brush-off. They know it's intentional (like A/B testing) but aren't allowed to admit it because it would cause backlash from users upset they're stuck with the ""ugly"" version. I never singed up for AB testing and don't know why I'm selected for it this is not the first time my UI always changes into some basic trash and I'm premium if someone is paying for the service they deserve the most updated UI why do some users get to have it and others don't?

Wertabob,Too much ads,"Yes the amount of songs in the app is crazy, however if you do not pay for premium it is an absolute nightmare to listen to music without an ad or two popping up after ONE SONG. It is so annoying, why would you make a music app if it is only going to be all ads. At this point your whole playlist just turns into a playlist of ads. Not only that, but every ad is the same there is no mix up,  yes it is annoying that after every song there is an ad, but the most annoying thing is how repetitive each one is. The only way to even enjoy listening to music is to pay for the pass. Which is so annoying because why would you market an app that is free, when the free isn't even worth it.  I am just sick of it because, I am a young person just trying to do homework, and I can't even focus with all of it. That's it, goodbye.",1,9.0.40,2025-05-11T15:33:41-07:00,us,2025-05-14 17:42:13

My daughter is now old enough to use the main Spotify app but there's a catch: all those horrible addictive YouTube videos are now on Spotify. 

Why? Who wants this? Why do I have zero control over my kids' accounts and why can I not disable videos for them?

Matthew Cohman,üåñ,"It doesn't keep the songs on your playlist when you get a new phone despite having an account. The app crashes too much. A lot of times it says ""Spotify offline"" and you have to reset your playlist which doesn't always work. It will say ""you need wifi to download songs"" despite the songs already being downloaded and you're paying premium so you can use Spotify offline. Also the app is so slow. If you have your playlist on shuffle it doesn't always play all your songs and restarts from the first song in that specific shuffle. Songs keep appearing on my playlist that I haven't added to it so I have to keep restarting the playlist because it's music I'm not interested in. Sometimes it will change a version of a song you have on your playlist to a censored version of the song without you doing so. I'll be listening to my playlist at the gym. Then when I get ready for work in the morning the same exact songs will play in the same order so I don't get to listen to my whole playlist most times.",2,9.0.40,2025-05-06T04:37:40-07:00,gb,2025-05-14 17:42:13

Bruyyy,Not user friendly,Dont get me wrong this app is good but if you're not bothered to spend money on subscriptions then your better off using soundcloud.

The thing that annoys me the most about  using Spotify on mobile with no premium is that I could want to listen to one song specifically, and I'll search for it, click on it to be met with some random song. Bear in mind you only get 6 skips an hour, so you may not even get to listen to the song you wanted to if it takes more than 6 skips to finally listen to it.

____User456,"To many ""premium"" features","Pls remove suggestions because whenever I try to listen to a playlist ,where I picked my own songs it will say we added this song which is very annoying pls remove.Also stop shuffle buttons because whenever I try to listen to a song it will always be a playlist,and it will be on shuffle 

There are to many features you must have premium for you can't even listen to specific songs COME ON PLS TONE DOWN THE AMOUNT OF FEATURES PREMIUM HAS.

its amazingly amazing!,good !!,"i really like spotify and always listen to my playlists whenevr i'm bored, but there's a few things i would change .

#1: when i listen to a playlist for too long, it starts playing random songs that aren't even on my playlist? i have tried googling it and switching it off on settings, but it still happens. pleaseee fix it ‚òπÔ∏è

#2: when you don't have spotify premium, i get you are meant to have ads but seriously there's like three 30 second ones in a row and then it says ""30 minutes of uninterrupted listening"" and then gives you 3 more like 5 minutes later, it's really annoying . 

#3: i don't know if they still do this, but when you don't have spotify premium you have a limit on seeing the lyrics per MONTH??? having a limit on seeing the lyrics is a bad idea anyways, but per month is just crazy üò≠ 

#4: it often lags, like my app is updated and i have full bars but sometimes when i click on spotify it just kicks me off and wont let me on the app. i dunno why it's doing this, i've googled it many times but it's not my phone that's the problem sooo ü§®‚Ä¶..

anyways, apart from that the app is really good! i spend hours listening to music every day and i am literally addicted to it ü´°

Mico helps your home page,Spotify is actually so unusable,I literally have a playlist with the same song for like 90 and they never play the song but random songs and the six skips per hour is actually so annoying like just play the song that is in the playlist or just let me to play the song on repeat. And the amount of ads are so annoying like every one song it's feel like 50 ads are on and they are so long for no apparent reason this why i use a different app while listening to music through my headphones.

Fatkid!,Great!,"Great! Thanks. Really enjoying hearing some of the old music I knew and either have, lost or missed over the years. Equally, I loving some of the old and fresh music I am now discovering and would probably have never heard. Spotify has also been great to refresh or familiarise myself of artists I am about to see at festivals, or make playlists of setlists of artists seen live. Only thing, which isn't really a complaint is, I often like to hear the original recordings and not all remastered versions of tracks/albums.

Katie_may04,Ridiculous,The App Store is only showing a few good reviews go look and other places for reviews for Spotify then you will see what it actually is which is rubbish. The app is awful if you don't pay then don't expect anything cause they don't even let you play what song you want. That's like saying if I don't pay for Snapchat premium when I snap someone it will send it to another person. Definitely will be switching from Spotify to something else.

EnderD7,Apparently 'free music',"As someone who doesn't pay apps any money, Spotify proposed its self as a free music app for everyone, but to listen to music in order or the way you want. You have to pay. This is a messed up practice. To lock behind basic features known as not having the music in shuffle needs to pay for. This is a basic feature to which shouldn't be behind a pay wall. The only features that should be behind that wall is add less listing. Not choosing in what order music is played in. All Spotify wants is you to pay a subscription for basic features. Not on",1,9.0.36,2025-04-24T03:03:17-07:00,au,2025-05-14 17:42:13

the brawler COOKIE,My Absolute Fav,"When it comes to listening to music, there are a ton of options! One that really stands out to me has got to be spotify. Im not saying the others are bad. Its just that Spotify is very generous, they dont force you to get the prenium account like other platforms. You can use the app without needing to upgrade, and Spotify won't bother you and won't rub it in your face that this is better. They want you to enjoy it, and care about the quality of their app. They consider quality before money, and that is the formula to success. They dont have their own ads etc. The features and qualities of this app are awesome and outweigh others. People don't want to spend money on listening to music, they just want enjoy and have it. Quality is very limited in the world. And boy, Spotify have succeeded in finding it.",5,9.0.32,2025-04-18T05:55:52-07:00,au,2025-05-14 17:42:13

On my playlist I delete a few songs and then add a couple more. I know that if you don't have 15 songs on your playlist it randomly selects songs based off your 'interests'. So can someone tell me why Spotify is playing the songs I removed? I removed them for a reason, so keep them off my playlist. And you know what makes it worse? Over time spotify plays more and more songs I don't want on my playlist and they progressively get worse and worse over time so when I skip all the songs I don't want I'm forced to listen to utterly horrible music.

I know prices are rising and the earths is drastically changing, but isn't it possible for there to be a cheeper premium were we're only allowed to access download songs and not have ads? cmon, im sure thousands of other people agree with me.

I tried deleting my browsing history and using incognito mode‚Äînothing worked. Eventually, I switched to Safari, but it doesn't work well there either. Every few songs, the audio goes mute.

While trying incognito mode, I had to use a code sent to my email, which worked for signing in. However, I later received an email saying that due to suspicious activity, I had to reset my password. Now, all my devices‚Äîincluding my car‚Äîhave to be signed in again and again.

It's personally really easy to use and very convenient. Unfortunately, since i've been on an holiday in China, the app has some issues to it. I don't have Spotify premium, and suddenly, whenever i play a random playlist, song or anything i can find or search up, everything says i need Spotify permuim. The song i used to play are all locked, reminding me i need Spotify premium. I'm not sure if its because i changed a location but didn't update my location in the app, or it's just a glitch. If i get back to my country again, and it still happens, i'm pretty sure somethings wrong with the app. If not, then i'm pretty sure its just the restrictions China has.

s;lkdfv;wlkeo,Extremely greedy,"Is it your goal to make the free version unusable? It is genuinely so infuriating how you keep taking away features from the free version and make them exclusive for premium. Honestly disappointing how greedy you guys are üòê. First, you ALREADY play what feels like thousands of ads, then take lyrics away, and now you force us to use smart shuffle (which is a very bad feature, ESPECIALLY when you force us to use it). Smart shuffle sucks. What if I don't want to listen to any other songs?? What if im trying to listen to someones album? I don't want to be bombed with songs that are not in that album, or even from the same artist. Let people play what they want to play. Not cool.

 1 Year Update: You've made it even worse. Now I'm not even able to play songs I want to play since thats now apparently a premium feature. Instead when i try that, you give me four ads in a row and play a different song. And now you've also brought back the 6 skips per hour thing as well. Why do you try to make this app unusable? Do you really care about your user quality or just money? Also I STILL get bombed with smart shuffle songs and now when I skip them I lose my 6 skips for the hour. If you really care about your customers then remove this stuff. Remove smart shuffle or make it happen less, give us unlimited skips like before, and actually let us play the songs we want to play. Why can't you make this app like the computer version??? Im fine with the computer version because it's usable but you guys are genuinely disgusting when it comes to the phone version.

This has been an ongoing issue but now it's not just my liked songs :( and this year I found the Spotify wrapped to be the most disappointing one as of yet, with none of the thought and effort put into it that made me want to subscribe to Spotify in the first place (probably because the folks who actually made the dang thing were first up on the chopping block for lay offs).

 want to waste my money on premium it's unfair that you can't listen to your chosen playlist without smart shuffle. As well as the fact that you only have 6 skips and song choices.

Rood34,The over complicated and bad shuffling makes it not worth your time,"Spotify's shuffle system feels like it's trying to outsmart itself‚Äîand failing. Instead of just, you know, shuffling, it tries to guess what you want to hear next based on who-knows-what, and the result is a mess. Songs repeat too often, others never show up, and the whole thing ends up feeling more like a curated loop than a true shuffle. It shouldn't take this much effort to hear my own music randomly. I'm giving it 3 stars because the rest of the app is fine, but the shuffle kills the experience.",2,9.0.40,2025-05-03T06:45:10-07:00,ca,2025-05-14 17:42:13

But atleast have the free version actually listenable. Artists sign contracts with spotify because a lot of people listen to music throught there, that includes free version enjoyers. Plus if im going to be honest, everyone goes to spotify because they dont want to pay for apple music, so why not appeal to those people??? Then show them what they COULD get with premium, but dont deny them of the basic experience, yall way too greedy.

afrobian,I moved to Apple Music,I moved to Apple Music after 8 years with this company. Why? because Spotify keeps feeding me music I already have in my library in the discovery and Daylist stations ‚Ä¶ now if the point is to discovering new music why is that 90% of the music I ALREADY HAVE.  Apple Music is much better if you take time to get used to their UI.  Also shoving podcasts in my throat is bananas. Have a separate dedicated app for that.

franny8553,So many issues,I have had this app for over a year after switching from Apple Music to try it out. I am switching back to Apple Music for several reasons. The algorithm is really off and I'm convinced it makes the artists play this weird game to beat the algorithm in order to get plays. Overall it plays the same suggested songs that I don't want. There is no recently played playlist that Apple Music has and does very well. My top artists were people I know I dont listen to nearly enough to have them on the top artists list. Making a playlist is so time consuming because you have to add each on individually. Whereas Apple Music you can search and add as many songs as you like on one go. The only reason I switched to Spotify was to go on my partners plan but now we both hate it. I really think Spotify should work on making their app more user friendly like Apple. I will say there are some songs Spotify has that Apple doesn't and vice versa but it's not enough of a difference to want to keep Spotify and at the end of the day you can YouTube any song.,1,9.0.36,2025-04-25T10:50:14-07:00,ca,2025-05-14 17:42:13

It really makes me angry because I just want to listen to a specific genre to match my vibe, but I can't do that if this dumb app keeps begging me for premium. It's pathetic, and ruins experiences for newer listeners.
Also, I found that a few weeks ago I was able to copy some songs from my liked songs playlist + transfer them to another to match the vibe I'm going for, but it's gone, so now I have to manually bring ALL of my newer liked songs into that playlist. A little side note, or the least you could do is add a select button.

MiamiSwissCheese,Too many adds,"Complaint part: Every time I click a button, an add pops up. It's really annoying and you need to pay to get rid of the every second add. Like, if I don't wanna listen to the song that's playing, instead of me just clicking to skip this song, I get an add. Don't like the song after that? Next song? No, add. Then you have to pay of all these adds to go away. 

Good part: If there weren't that many adds, it'd be 5/5 stars!",4,9.0.32,2025-04-16T14:34:14-07:00,ca,2025-05-14 17:42:13

Maneet.,Might as well get Apple Music now,"Their algorithm and AI suggestions lack a human touch. I am unhappy with the suggestions I have been getting. The ""made for you"" playlists are a joke.

When all I wanted was to just listen to the song once. That is just an example of a bigger issue that began just over a year ago.

If the listener is not best familiar with it he has no idea of 'what-all' the APP system can do for him. Of how he can organise and use  the APP. to deliver exactly what he needs.
May be there are tutorials on it, but I have not come across the feature. 
Hence one visits the App listens and moves on.

Sometimes when I download the app on a device and sign up a new account, the playlist feature would be quite strange. Usually I wouldn't let me play a certain song from my playlist and wouldn't show me the list at all. On some of my other devices, the app works incredibly well. There problems. I searched it up on google and google said it was because I didn't have Spotify premium. In that case, my other device is working like Spotify premium without me paying!

Jordan_ lika_boss,Spotify crashing,"I can probably listen to 5-10 songs in a row if I'm lucky before my app will crash (very awesome feature when you're on a run/exercising!) 

Have tried hard restarting, deleting and reinstalling app, logging out, different settings etc. nothing will fix it. 

 I have been a paid subscriber for many many years now, reaching over 2500 songs in my library and playlists alone. I have recently moved over to Apple Music and probably won't resubscribe again to Spotify unless the issue can be fixed. 

The service itself (being able to listen to songs and podcasts/books) can't be flawed. But the crashing makes it impossible to enjoy.",5,8.9.86,2024-11-04T16:30:35-07:00,nz,2025-05-14 17:42:13

‚ú®ellie (taylor's version)‚ú®,Spotify Review,i love spotify. i use it pretty much everyday for listening to my music and it's one of my favourite apps. it's got all the best singers and musicians of history. the one annoying thing is for the non-premium users it has many ads you can't skip and only six skips an hour. this is annoying because if you accidentally skip a song you've wasted a skip and if i don't use all my skips- say i use three skips- then i will only have three skips the next hour. other than that spotify is my go-to for music and i love it! thank you for reading!,4,8.9.82,2024-10-20T12:04:01-07:00,nz,2025-05-14 17:42:13

Firstly, the audio quality feels outdated, especially considering it's 2024 and the platform still only supports MP3. Secondly, the company's apparent lack of support for artists is concerning.

Competitors like Tidal have similar features, but with CD and higher audio quality and also pay artists fairly.",3,8.9.70,2024-09-06T12:04:08-07:00,nz,2025-05-14 17:42:13

Very bad communication on Spotify's part on not clearly communicating what I needed to do earlier and misinforming me that it's already resolved when it's not.

Ssophos,Spotify is getting worse every year,"Spotify used to be a great app for free music, with the occasional ad. Now, everything is premium and reeks of corporate greed.

Everything is soulless and is ""powered"" by AI. Playlists full of AI generated music gets recommended and shoved into your face 24/7 by Spotify, which is so ridiculous because instead of actually talented HUMAN artists receiving money, Spotify gets to keep everything and force you to listen to trash and repetitive regurgitated AI slop that they call ""music"". 

Instead of writing their own genres for Spotify wrapped (what used to be a fun and original Christmas special showcasing everything you've listened to throughout the year), they just generated random prompts and took all of the soul out of it.

It's overall a good app however there is two things that really haven't gotten much better, or even worse, over time. One is that the music recommendations and ""radios"" are basically always playing the same songs and bands - rarely that something new comes up. Quite boring.
The second thing is, and that really really goes on my nerves, that whether on my phone or on my laptop the app just is unable to play very often. It just hangs and I need to restart it. It's like there is no internet - but there is. This happens multiple times a week and it's an absolute joke.",3,9.0.32,2025-04-16T07:34:53-07:00,za,2025-05-14 17:42:13

The Seacow,Dumb Shuffle,"The smart shuffle feature can be a great way to find new songs but functions strangely by playing a predetermined selection of songs depending on which song you start with in your playlist. So it doesn't actually shuffle randomly. It also seems to only shuffle from certain sections depending on where you start it in a playlist if you have a lot of songs in the playlist like your Liked Songs playlist. 

Sponsored recommendations are awful and borderline paid for ads from artists trying to get noticed. Regardless of your tastes or genres they will get pushed in your face based on your country and will not be to your tastes at all. I get better artist recommendations on Spotify in Instagram ads which is a joke. 

The AI DJ is‚Ä¶yeah. Just no. There is no intelligence there at all. Just lazily pushing genres and top artists based on your location again instead of finding you new music based on your actual tastes and listening history. Gave up trying to train it and repeatedly hiding the same artists and songs I don't like. 

Daily mixes have become incredibly lazy to the point where even when you ""hide"" a song in the playlist it will refresh with the same song still hidden 2 days later with all the same artists in the same order. Also, downloaded songs and albums that are classified as ""liked"" songs even though they don't appear in your ""liked songs"" playlist is confusing and stupid.",3,9.0.26,2025-03-15T01:57:06-07:00,za,2025-05-14 17:42:13

GrumpyGrouper,I just wish it would work properly.,"Honestly, for what it tries (or tried) to do, Spotify is great. I've had some great artists recommended to me by the algorithms, and the aesthetic of the app is fantastic. The true shame lies in the fact that the app's core functionality as an audio streaming platform is becoming increasingly sidelined with each update. I have been having more issues (freezes, song skipping, song fast-forwarding, audio artefacts, difficulty pairing to Bluetooth) seemingly with every update. These are issues that are not exclusive to me and my device, for everyone that I know who uses Spotify has reported the same issues independently.  
It's just a pity to see, what was once my favourite app, be systematically butchered. I don't care about your stupid ""Spotify wrapped"", I just want the app to work consistently, that's all.
Oh yes, and added a star because the ""Jam"" feature is pretty cool.

Rogz999,No music videos on Apple TV?,Love Spotify. Love Spotify music videos even more. What a massive disappointment to find the official Spotify app for Apple TV does not support music videos!?!?!? Why not? I don't want to watch music videos on my tiny phone screen. I want to watch them on my giant TV. Come on Spotify? Seriously?,4,8.9.96,2024-12-09T06:28:27-07:00,za,2025-05-14 17:42:13
