DontaBuya,Most greedy app I've used,"The only way to not be plagued with multiple advertisements between every song you listen to is paying for the premium version. This wouldn't be an issue if it were a few ads every once and awhile right? Wrong. If you have Spotify free for whatever reason, you will hear no less than 4 ads after every song. You will hear more advertisements then actual music. When your ""Spotify wrapped"" comes out in November, it should actually show; 1. Draft Kings, 2. ""WHOOPS dID i JuSt iNTeRuPt yOuR jAm sEssIOn"" 3. Random podcasters you've never heard of pushing their stream, 4. Random artists you've never heard of pushing their albums, 5. ""Dun dun, dun dun dun dun, dun dun dun dun"" (the last one is draft kings again) because the entire free side of the app is nothing but ads. Go listen to the radio. Because you might not get to hear exactly what you want, but at least their will be less ads, and less obnoxious ads. Whistle a tune or hum a song from memory.

Joey @sassygamergirl,This app is amazing!!!,"Ok so my friend doesn't have premium and I do and not having premium can be ultra annoying. First every like 5 or 6 songs there is an ad and it gets to be annoying. Next, you can't just pick a so g to play. You have to pick a playlist and a random song plays. I personally think you should be able to pick whatever song you choose. Lastly, premium is just way better than non premium and I think you should add some options to non premium that just aren't fair to have them on premium but not have them on non premium. These are the things. Number 1, non premium members should be able to pick whatever song they please. Number 2, adds you get in between songs, the number of songs in between each ad is ALWAYS randomized. Sometimes it is 8 songs or 2 or 5 etc. make it a specific number like 5 or 10. This is my review. You probably didn't stay t9 the end but if you are reading this right now thank you! And get premium it is so much better!!

Rpgalltheway,They Keep Making It Worse,"Spotify knows they keep making their product worse and worse, they have to know, they get bombarded with suggestions and requests because heavens forbid any tech company actually field real support and feedback, let's just leave it up to blogs and forums and let the consumers do the thinking for us. It seems Spotify has fully embraced the asinine trends of terrible US tech companies like Meta and Amazon.

I was finally prompted to actually write a review because of the most recent display update that added the annoying create button in the spot where Library used to be. Library is the primary screen most people use, and now the screen real estate is messed up for what reason? To put all the social features in one inconvenient place? I never have and never will want to use any of the create tools, and guess what they were all fine exactly where they were, never had any trouble finding them before. 

I also don't want to keep paying an increased subscription price for an app that can't load downloaded content correctly when the network is congested. There doesn't seem to be the common sense feature that if network speeds do not meet a certain threshold then toggle offline mode so people can still access offline content appropriately. Instead of having a bloated app that consumes too many resources that essentially crashes when the network speeds are good enough to navigate everything on the app but not good enough stream, making it so you still somehow can't access downloaded content because streaming can't happen and offline mode has to be toggled on to access it.

I also don't want to pay for audiobooks I never listen to, if you're trying to poach Audible subscribers the answer was to not subsidize the feature by making it seem like a beneficial extra to the base subscription and then upping the price. Make a music+audiobook subscription tier and have it cost $2 more than the base premium. Same with the new video hosting, I don't want to pay for Spotify's new video hosting servers, I want a dedicated quality music app and now the vision is clearly gone.

The only people that want what Spotify is currently doing are the executives that can get more money from even the worst ideas (because somehow even terribly implemented features = increased subscription price) and the people who believe them when they get told these are all good things. The amount of good ideas and feature requests and feature removal requests (looking at you smart shuffle) completely ignored on the forums exemplify that Spotify clearly does not care. 

All these features should be opt-in/toggle-able at the very least, and removed immediately for others.

This is a great time to start supporting artists directly, purchasing tracks so you can have them forever, and not rely on companies that make things consistently worse to dictate your experiences.",1,9.0.40,2025-05-13T17:50:37-07:00,us,2025-05-15 16:01:10

mda2347,So many glitches,"I really want to love this app, but it has frequent unneeded design updates, causing bugs and glitches when it was good the way it was. In addition to a create button on the bottom right that was never asked for, the ui designer decided to also move ""offline mode"" to a different section. Offline mode is so buggy that it turns itself off constantly, within less than 12 hours of turning it on. Please focus on fixing the design of your app instead of unnecessary changes and adding in features like ig stories-like discovery sections and ""create"" buttons that mimic social media apps like Instagram and tiktok. Spotify is a music app and should function as one first, not try to become a social media app and play in a lane that it doesn't belong in.",2,9.0.40,2025-05-13T17:21:32-07:00,us,2025-05-15 16:01:10

yoinkles,UI Madness Continues,"For so many years I have been fed up with Spotify's incessant UI changes, none of which improve usability. Now that the Library tab has been moved and replaced with a Create tab I am officially done. There is a long list of UI decisions that I believe are terrible, but most of those are more nit-pick. This change is much more impactful. It means I will have to undo years of reflexively tapping the lower right to go to the Library. No one was asking for a persistent button to create playlists.

sr58362,"Option to disable ""smart"" shuffle pls","Would love a way to permanently disable smart shuffle. Recommendations are bad and I often accidentally delete my queue trying to remove the unwanted songs. Spotify algorithm is disappointing- I find that I'm never recommended anything that hasn't been released recently which is a shame- I would love to be able to use the algorithm to find old gems instead of whatever new slop is trending. Also more and more albums are being removed- I find songs I loved suddenly greyed out and unplayable. Spotify is a fun novelty but unless options are added to allow users to avoid the incoming ai slop, I can't see myself paying for it much longer when cds are so cheap. Also the app just won't load a lot of the time, not worth paying for",1,9.0.40,2025-05-13T12:35:41-07:00,us,2025-05-15 16:01:10

hypothetical tsar bomba,unnecessary update,"spotify just randomly updated to add a create tab? i find this really stupid, no one is so desperate to create a jam that they need a shortcut. ive been using spotify for years and it feels like a good 85% or more of the updates are completely unnecessary and/or ""fixing"" problems that were never problems (the only helpful thing i can remember from the last few years was making it easier to add songs to playlists, but even then you have to add it to your liked songs to use the shortcut, and you have to do the whole thing twice to remove it if you dont want it there). changing something as big as the bottom menu is so unnecessary in this case, it just feels like changing it to change it. now i have to change my muscle memory to accommodate this pointless update.",2,9.0.40,2025-05-13T12:10:36-07:00,us,2025-05-15 16:01:10

DSMSDBFORCEDS,"Spotify as of May, 2025","I have been paying for Premium around nine years. Spotify wants to be a social media platform. Years ago, I used its algorithm as a discovery engine. It was decent. The fake AI stuff snuck up on me, and now Spotify feels as overrun with AI entities as Meta or any other dangerous internet space. It's starting to feel like a vanity publication. Artists, contributors, content providers be aware you're paying a social media platform to use your creative work any way it can. For these reasons, I don't see Spotify as creator, artist, or podcaster friendly. I don't think Joe Rogan pays for Spotify Creator or whatever the podcast product is now called. Spotify is still worth the approximately ten dollars per month I now pay  but if a similar app comes along that doesn't want to be another everything app like Meta, WeChat, or Amazon I might be jumping ship then.",2,9.0.40,2025-05-13T10:05:28-07:00,us,2025-05-15 16:01:10
