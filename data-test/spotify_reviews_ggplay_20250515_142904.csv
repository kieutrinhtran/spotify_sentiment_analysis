Sometimes runs for an hour, sometimes 15 minutes, other times one track. Then, I have to open the app again. Pretty frustrating. Also, why can't I decide what content I see, I want to set the genres I see, not interested in what YOU push or suggest, which is usually nothing like what I would like to hear. I also have no interest in podcasts, but I constantly get them pushed at me. Might be time to try Apple or Deezer",3,20,9.0.20.604,2025-02-21 00:24:13,"Hi there!
