Johnny Sullivan,Nothing but ads now,This app used to be decent until the constant 1:30 - 3:00 ads that pop up every few songs. God forbid you try to skip a song. That's another ad. Spotify developers are intentionally doing this to try and push us to pay for premium. Might as well listen to the radio at this point.,1,9.0.40,2025-05-12T19:29:48-07:00,us,2025-05-14 17:27:02

bob (not bob,LOVE THIS APP!!!,"Ok I love Spotify and I prefer it over Apple Music. BUT, I do have a few things that I think need improvement. I don't have Spotify premium and I'm not saying allow certain things that you allow in premium, but things that premium also doesn't include. First, I hate how you can't search for songs in your library(or in playlists). Next, I hate how you can't play all your songs at once, like you can in Apple Music. The only reason I know this is because my family has a plan on Apple Music but I'm gonna start paying for Apple Music soon the only reason I haven't yet is bc I don't have a credit card yet(I'm 15). Lastly, and idk if this is just my phone, but sometimes when I'm on an ad, it won't let me get out of it. It won't let me look at my other playlists or search something or anything. So idk if that was intentional or not. That's all! Everything else is great and I loveeee this app! Idk what I would do without itüòÖ",5,9.0.40,2025-05-12T18:09:19-07:00,us,2025-05-14 17:27:02

Walk it off ho3,Lack of transparency,"It kinda bothers me that when i had downloaded this app again as i do every once and a while when i get offered a  deal on the subscription, i noticed that the UI that was present in first few minutes was nice and sleek more modern if you will and i liked it (aesthetically speaking) well in minutes i realized it reverted to the dull  basic UI and it was so off putting. I contacted Spotify and they told me to wait while they looked into it 3 times telling me thanks for your patience blah blah, after 15 minutes the message I received was ""we don't have any information to offer on this issue, thanks for contacting Spotify"" and they ended the chat‚Ä¶ Classic corporate runaround‚Äî""we're looking into it"" followed by radio silence and a generic brush-off. They know it's intentional (like A/B testing) but aren't allowed to admit it because it would cause backlash from users upset they're stuck with the ""ugly"" version. I never singed up for AB testing and don't know why I'm selected for it this is not the first time my UI always changes into some basic trash and I'm premium if someone is paying for the service they deserve the most updated UI why do some users get to have it and others don't?

Wertabob,Too much ads,"Yes the amount of songs in the app is crazy, however if you do not pay for premium it is an absolute nightmare to listen to music without an ad or two popping up after ONE SONG. It is so annoying, why would you make a music app if it is only going to be all ads. At this point your whole playlist just turns into a playlist of ads. Not only that, but every ad is the same there is no mix up,  yes it is annoying that after every song there is an ad, but the most annoying thing is how repetitive each one is. The only way to even enjoy listening to music is to pay for the pass. Which is so annoying because why would you market an app that is free, when the free isn't even worth it.  I am just sick of it because, I am a young person just trying to do homework, and I can't even focus with all of it. That's it, goodbye.",1,9.0.40,2025-05-11T15:33:41-07:00,us,2025-05-14 17:27:02

Max Bilbow,No longer safe for your screen addicted kids.,"We manage our kids' screen-time and have always viewed music and audiobooks as something that should always be available. 

My daughter is now old enough to use the main Spotify app but there's a catch: all those horrible addictive YouTube videos are now on Spotify. 

Why? Who wants this? Why do I have zero control over my kids' accounts and why can I not disable videos for them?

As a family account subscriber, this is a real dealbreaker for me. I want my kids to enjoy and appreciate music. But Spotify is no longer appropriate for this.",2,9.0.40,2025-05-07T04:14:50-07:00,gb,2025-05-14 17:27:02

Matthew Cohman,üåñ,"It doesn't keep the songs on your playlist when you get a new phone despite having an account. The app crashes too much. A lot of times it says ""Spotify offline"" and you have to reset your playlist which doesn't always work. It will say ""you need wifi to download songs"" despite the songs already being downloaded and you're paying premium so you can use Spotify offline. Also the app is so slow. If you have your playlist on shuffle it doesn't always play all your songs and restarts from the first song in that specific shuffle. Songs keep appearing on my playlist that I haven't added to it so I have to keep restarting the playlist because it's music I'm not interested in. Sometimes it will change a version of a song you have on your playlist to a censored version of the song without you doing so. I'll be listening to my playlist at the gym. Then when I get ready for work in the morning the same exact songs will play in the same order so I don't get to listen to my whole playlist most times.",2,9.0.40,2025-05-06T04:37:40-07:00,gb,2025-05-14 17:27:02

Bruyyy,Not user friendly,Dont get me wrong this app is good but if you're not bothered to spend money on subscriptions then your better off using soundcloud.

Secondly, the AI DJ is fantastic but it would be better if you could queue up your own songs between the suggestions - if you've got the DJ playing, songs you queue up aren't actually queued & you need to start playing a specific song/playlist to get the queue functionality to work.",4,9.0.36,2025-05-02T00:28:33-07:00,gb,2025-05-14 17:27:02

The thing that annoys me the most about  using Spotify on mobile with no premium is that I could want to listen to one song specifically, and I'll search for it, click on it to be met with some random song. Bear in mind you only get 6 skips an hour, so you may not even get to listen to the song you wanted to if it takes more than 6 skips to finally listen to it.

its amazingly amazing!,good !!,"i really like spotify and always listen to my playlists whenevr i'm bored, but there's a few things i would change .

#1: when i listen to a playlist for too long, it starts playing random songs that aren't even on my playlist? i have tried googling it and switching it off on settings, but it still happens. pleaseee fix it ‚òπÔ∏è

#2: when you don't have spotify premium, i get you are meant to have ads but seriously there's like three 30 second ones in a row and then it says ""30 minutes of uninterrupted listening"" and then gives you 3 more like 5 minutes later, it's really annoying . 

#3: i don't know if they still do this, but when you don't have spotify premium you have a limit on seeing the lyrics per MONTH??? having a limit on seeing the lyrics is a bad idea anyways, but per month is just crazy üò≠ 

#4: it often lags, like my app is updated and i have full bars but sometimes when i click on spotify it just kicks me off and wont let me on the app. i dunno why it's doing this, i've googled it many times but it's not my phone that's the problem sooo ü§®‚Ä¶..

anyways, apart from that the app is really good! i spend hours listening to music every day and i am literally addicted to it ü´°

Mico helps your home page,Spotify is actually so unusable,I literally have a playlist with the same song for like 90 and they never play the song but random songs and the six skips per hour is actually so annoying like just play the song that is in the playlist or just let me to play the song on repeat. And the amount of ads are so annoying like every one song it's feel like 50 ads are on and they are so long for no apparent reason this why i use a different app while listening to music through my headphones. Like I only use Spotify when I'm cleaning the kitchen or when I don't get ads,2,9.0.32,2025-04-22T09:44:10-07:00,gb,2025-05-14 17:27:02

Equally, I loving some of the old and fresh music I am now discovering and would probably have never heard. Spotify has also been great to refresh or familiarise myself of artists I am about to see at festivals, or make playlists of setlists of artists seen live.

Katie_may04,Ridiculous,The App Store is only showing a few good reviews go look and other places for reviews for Spotify then you will see what it actually is which is rubbish. The app is awful if you don't pay then don't expect anything cause they don't even let you play what song you want. That's like saying if I don't pay for Snapchat premium when I snap someone it will send it to another person. Definitely will be switching from Spotify to something else.

However, lately, when I open the iOS app, it will play some random song within the genre of whatever I was listening to last. This never happened before. And my windows desktop app doesn't have this issue. 

Sometimes it does this while I'm actively listening to a playlist: I'll open the app to adjust the playlist and before I can do anything it'll play some random song and mess up my playlist. 

Honestly it's 5 star app. Thanks for the hard work. But this latest issue is so annoying that I feel the need to 1 star it for attention. Please developers, fix it.",1,9.0.32,2025-04-10T17:19:40-07:00,jp,2025-05-14 17:27:02

Im just being honest1234,It's really good but‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.,It's really good but i think you could have a bit more videos like there will still be songs but some more videos like ticktock or stufff anywho next problem like i think there should be a button to just select songs in you playlist and the press like delete all '37' songs or so because i hate going thru my playlist and deleting them 1 by 1 and cou;d their be a button that lets u delete all songs in ur favorites so u can start again because lots of the songs in my playlist are cringey and I dont want to have to delete all of them 1 by 1 ALSO IF WE BUY PREMIUM LET US HAVE PREMEUIM FOREVER UNTIL OUR ACCOUNT EXPIRES BUT THAT DOESNT MEAN YOU SHOULD MAKE OUR ACCOINTS EXPIRE SOONER!!!!

EnderD7,Apparently 'free music',"As someone who doesn't pay apps any money, Spotify proposed its self as a free music app for everyone, but to listen to music in order or the way you want. You have to pay. This is a messed up practice. To lock behind basic features known as not having the music in shuffle needs to pay for. This is a basic feature to which shouldn't be behind a pay wall. The only features that should be behind that wall is add less listing. Not choosing in what order music is played in.

Its just that Spotify is very generous, they dont force you to get the prenium account like other platforms. You can use the app without needing to upgrade, and Spotify won't bother you and won't rub it in your face that this is better. They want you to enjoy it, and care about the quality of their app. They consider quality before money, and that is the formula to success. They dont have their own ads etc. The features and qualities of this app are awesome and outweigh others. People don't want to spend money on listening to music, they just want enjoy and have it.

On my playlist I delete a few songs and then add a couple more. I know that if you don't have 15 songs on your playlist it randomly selects songs based off your 'interests'. So can someone tell me why Spotify is playing the songs I removed? I removed them for a reason, so keep them off my playlist. And you know what makes it worse? Over time spotify plays more and more songs I don't want on my playlist and they progressively get worse and worse over time so when I skip all the songs I don't want I'm forced to listen to utterly horrible music. If anyone can help me fix this issue that would be great because I can't be arsed buying premium.",2,9.0.32,2025-04-17T05:49:00-07:00,au,2025-05-14 17:27:02

_üé∂_,money.,"SPOTIFY IS MY FAVOURITE APP BUT im in high school (31 üîÑ). how am i supposed to pay $167 per year for premium? iv never paid for premium because my parents think its a ""waste of money"". I get it, you probably don't want to pay for an online experience for your child. but i could pay for it myself, right? wrong. i get $20 a month, and since premium is $13.99 a month i AM able to do it. but imagine you had to give 70% of your salary to someone every month. how would that feel? it would practically limit me from buying anything else. what am i supposed to buy with $6 in this economy? a piece of candy? and i know I'm young but I'm not clueless. I know prices are rising and the earths is drastically changing, but isn't it possible for there to be a cheeper premium were we're only allowed to access download songs and not have ads? cmon, im sure thousands of other people agree with me. Im sure one of you'r hundreds of developers have considered this. so why haven't you made it a possibility? anyways, not hate to spotify, I LOVE THE APP, but cmon‚ÄºÔ∏è",4,9.0.32,2025-04-17T03:57:37-07:00,au,2025-05-14 17:27:02

I tried deleting my browsing history and using incognito mode‚Äînothing worked. Eventually, I switched to Safari, but it doesn't work well there either. Every few songs, the audio goes mute.

While trying incognito mode, I had to use a code sent to my email, which worked for signing in. However, I later received an email saying that due to suspicious activity, I had to reset my password. Now, all my devices‚Äîincluding my car‚Äîhave to be signed in again and again.

This level of security and hassle doesn't make sense for a music app. Even my bank account isn't that strict. They could easily verify everything through the phone I've been signed in on for years.",1,9.0.32,2025-04-15T06:07:16-07:00,au,2025-05-14 17:27:02

The song i used to play are all locked, reminding me i need Spotify premium. I'm not sure if its because i changed a location but didn't update my location in the app, or it's just a glitch. If i get back to my country again, and it still happens, i'm pretty sure somethings wrong with the app. If not, then i'm pretty sure its just the restrictions China has.

s;lkdfv;wlkeo,Extremely greedy,"Is it your goal to make the free version unusable? It is genuinely so infuriating how you keep taking away features from the free version and make them exclusive for premium. Honestly disappointing how greedy you guys are üòê. First, you ALREADY play what feels like thousands of ads, then take lyrics away, and now you force us to use smart shuffle (which is a very bad feature, ESPECIALLY when you force us to use it). Smart shuffle sucks. What if I don't want to listen to any other songs?? What if im trying to listen to someones album? I don't want to be bombed with songs that are not in that album, or even from the same artist. Let people play what they want to play. Not cool.

 1 Year Update: You've made it even worse. Now I'm not even able to play songs I want to play since thats now apparently a premium feature. Instead when i try that, you give me four ads in a row and play a different song. And now you've also brought back the 6 skips per hour thing as well. Why do you try to make this app unusable? Do you really care about your user quality or just money? Also I STILL get bombed with smart shuffle songs and now when I skip them I lose my 6 skips for the hour. If you really care about your customers then remove this stuff. Remove smart shuffle or make it happen less, give us unlimited skips like before, and actually let us play the songs we want to play. Why can't you make this app like the computer version??? Im fine with the computer version because it's usable but you guys are genuinely disgusting when it comes to the phone version.

SharperZero,"From a premium subscriber: DO NOT UPGRADE TO PAID, App functionality at an all time low","The app has been riddled with disappointing glitches and issues that make me heavily consider going back to physical media or god forbid Apple Music. As of right now if I try to scroll to a specific section in my liked songs, without fail it will make me go all the way to the bottom, not where I'm trying to go. This has been an ongoing issue but now it's not just my liked songs :( and this year I found the Spotify wrapped to be the most disappointing one as of yet, with none of the thought and effort put into it that made me want to subscribe to Spotify in the first place (probably because the folks who actually made the dang thing were first up on the chopping block for lay offs). Combine both of those already pressing issues with the ever increasing price for a service no longer maintaining it's functionality, I think I can speak for us all when I say (as a nearly ten year subscriber to Spotify premium) that Spotify is no longer the choice for those Audiophiles among us.",1,9.0.40,2025-05-05T10:48:14-07:00,ca,2025-05-14 17:27:02

Songs repeat too often, others never show up, and the whole thing ends up feeling more like a curated loop than a true shuffle. It shouldn't take this much effort to hear my own music randomly.

But atleast have the free version actually listenable. Artists sign contracts with spotify because a lot of people listen to music throught there, that includes free version enjoyers. Plus if im going to be honest, everyone goes to spotify because they dont want to pay for apple music, so why not appeal to those people??? Then show them what they COULD get with premium, but dont deny them of the basic experience, yall way too greedy.

afrobian,I moved to Apple Music,I moved to Apple Music after 8 years with this company. Why? because Spotify keeps feeding me music I already have in my library in the discovery and Daylist stations ‚Ä¶ now if the point is to discovering new music why is that 90% of the music I ALREADY HAVE.  Apple Music is much better if you take time to get used to their UI.  Also shoving podcasts in my throat is bananas. Have a separate dedicated app for that.  I'm not going back to Spotify but I hope you take this feedback seriously for the sake of your subscribers.,1,9.0.36,2025-04-25T15:05:11-07:00,ca,2025-05-14 17:27:02
franny8553,So many issues,I have had this app for over a year after switching from Apple Music to try it out. I am switching back to Apple Music for several reasons. The algorithm is really off and I'm convinced it makes the artists play this weird game to beat the algorithm in order to get plays. Overall it plays the same suggested songs that I don't want. There is no recently played playlist that Apple Music has and does very well. My top artists were people I know I dont listen to nearly enough to have them on the top artists list. Making a playlist is so time consuming because you have to add each on individually. Whereas Apple Music you can search and add as many songs as you like on one go. The only reason I switched to Spotify was to go on my partners plan but now we both hate it. I really think Spotify should work on making their app more user friendly like Apple. I will say there are some songs Spotify has that Apple doesn't and vice versa but it's not enough of a difference to want to keep Spotify and at the end of the day you can YouTube any song.,1,9.0.36,2025-04-25T10:50:14-07:00,ca,2025-05-14 17:27:02

Manguyman,Audio books,"I was initially excited when audiobooks were added,  but it seems that they only added them to make people mad, I have a full subscription,  but half way through a book I was notified there is a un-advertised limit to audiobook listening.  No where does it give you more info if you hit this limit so better keep trying every day if you want to keep listening.  If you listen to too much music in between listening to your book, Spotify will hide that book from you so you can't easily find and resume listening.

Yippieeeyahoo,I genuinely hate this app üíî,"I used to like it, when I was able to play anything from my liked songs freely until I apparently only have 6 skips per hour‚Ä¶? Plus when I play a specific genre of music in my liked songs it switches to a completely different genre entirely and says that all of my songs are now randomly selected. It really makes me angry because I just want to listen to a specific genre to match my vibe, but I can't do that if this dumb app keeps begging me for premium. It's pathetic, and ruins experiences for newer listeners.
Also, I found that a few weeks ago I was able to copy some songs from my liked songs playlist + transfer them to another to match the vibe I'm going for, but it's gone, so now I have to manually bring ALL of my newer liked songs into that playlist. A little side note, or the least you could do is add a select button.

taebaeck,please let me undo 'remove this song from playlist',"its all good and all but,
1. i constantly press 'remove this song from playlist' while trying to add it to another playlist by mistake. the UI are very close to each other and i assume i will be repeating the same mistake again as I am bad with mobile devices and often have trouble pressing exactly what i want, unless i'm staring right at it! haha. i think it'd be better to have 'undo' option for the popup that says it successfully removed the song, instead of changing the arrangement to make UIs stay apart etc. just like how the popup shows up when i add a song to a playlist by pressing plus icon in song detail screen, and it has 'change' option on the right. 

2. i keep seeing k-music recommendations(not only kpop but as a whole) based on my region, but i prefer to explore more songs from other countries. hopefully that is something feasible in later updates.

but in general, i am satisfied",4,9.0.22,2025-03-05T13:55:54-07:00,kr,2025-05-14 17:27:02

Buenasss___,Sobre Spotify free (gratis),Antes el uso de spotify free era 4 estrellas pero ahora la cambiado (o eso creo) y ahora tienes que pagar el premium para poder las letras de las canciones tantas veces que quieras. Con Spotify free solo puedes verlo como 1-3 letras de canciones al MES y eso me enfada porque yo soy la t√≠pica persona que ve las letras de las canciones que salen nuevas para aprenderme la letra. Tambi√©n entiendo que Spotify tienen que ganar algo de los usuarios de Spotify free pero √∫ltimamente me salen anuncios cada dos canciones.

Lynx-spain,"Spotify, It's Time to Lead Again","I've been using Spotify Premium for years and love it for its vast library and intelligent algorithm, but I feel it's starting to fall behind. Not only in terms of audio quality, but also in its overall design and innovation. The interface is beginning to feel cluttered, and at times, counterintuitive. If any changes are urgent, it's the user interface ‚Äî this is the first impression for every listener, and it should feel modern, clean, and intuitive. Customers should immediately feel that Spotify is the number one music streaming service the moment they open the app.

Right now, many users stay not because it's the best, but because it's what their friends use. That kind of network effect won't last forever ‚Äî especially as competitors continue to refine their offerings. If another service emerges that offers cross-platform compatibility, superior or even the same audio quality, but with a cleaner, more forward-thinking design, Spotify could lose ground quickly.

Given the pace of innovation across tech and social media platforms, there's no reason Spotify shouldn't be leading the charge. With the tools, data, and creative power it has access to, it could introduce features that completely redefine what a music app can be. One idea is allowing users to save segments of songs ‚Äî not just the full track ‚Äî for custom playlists. Imagine building a gym playlist made entirely of high-energy hooks or fast-paced verses to help control your tempo during a run or training session. Or a study mix composed of ambient intros and instrumental bridges. These ""music quotes"" would let listeners curate mood-specific playlists with surgical precision. It would be a game-changer for personalization and give users more control over how they experience music.

Spotify could also embrace the tech world's playbook and launch these features during yearly live or recorded keynote events. This would build excitement, create a sense of community, and reinforce Spotify's image as a true innovator in the audio space.

Additionally, introducing a modern take on live radio could bring a fresh dynamic to the platform. Think live-streaming the most-heard global hits in real time or giving users access to traditional FM radio stations within Spotify's ecosystem ‚Äî complete with the ability to instantly save a song from a broadcast to a personal playlist. It would merge the nostalgia and spontaneity of traditional radio with the convenience and control of digital streaming.

Spotify has the infrastructure, user base, and brand loyalty to lead the industry forward ‚Äî but it needs to start acting like the leader again. And that begins with reimagining the interface and showing users that the best is yet to come.

Signed, a loyal customer who really doesn't want to leave ‚Äî but will, if things don't start to move forward.",5,9.0.32,2025-04-20T02:16:17-07:00,es,2025-05-14 17:27:02

ADARSH SARAN,Overall - the App,"As must be common user chanced upon the APP bug has no idea of what the extent of features are and how best these can be used.
If the listener is not best familiar with it he has no idea of 'what-all' the APP system can do for him. Of how he can organise and use  the APP. to deliver exactly what he needs.
May be there are tutorials on it, but I have not come across the feature. 
Hence one visits the App listens and moves on.

On 16 March my premium Plan was discontinued despite assurances that it's resolved !

Very bad communication on Spotify's part on not clearly communicating what I needed to do earlier and misinforming me that it's already resolved when it's not. 

They just kept repeating that it's not their intention to make it difficult for me and about family Premium Plan owner and members must live at the same address.

Their app is very good with a huge database of songs. Their customer service replies very fast but have to learn to be clearer in communication and apologise immediately when they made a mistake.",2,9.0.26,2025-03-17T00:35:17-07:00,sg,2025-05-14 17:27:02

Spotify is not a bad app and premium is also not a bad idea  for business so I'm not saying remove premium I'm saying reduce the feeling of being obligated to buy premium to properly use Spotify and it's not expensive I'll give you that but some people are not in a position to be purchasing things sometimes",1,9.0.36,2025-04-28T14:31:33-07:00,th,2025-05-14 17:27:02

Fyei_,There has to be a better way,"Whenever when I was in the middle of playing a Playlist, then sometimes I came across a song, whether it's suggested by Spotify in one way or another, then I listened to it halfway and deemed it's worth to try to go to the Artist's profile to listen to a few more songs, before deciding whether it's worth Following that Artist or not. 
But there's no easy way to add ,for example the top 10 songs or 5 most recent singles ,of that Artist to my Queue / add to my Other Playlists. 
There has to be a better, easier, more seamless way in the Spotify UI to do this, sort of a mini ""Audition"" if you will, from that Artist, to me, before I decide if I like them enough to Follow. Then afterwards, seamlessly continuing listening to the next items in the Playlist where I left off.
It'd be great if there's a way in the UI buttons to easily add the top 10 most popular songs from that Artist to my Other Playlist, 4-6 most recent Singles, all songs from 1-2 most recent Album. Maybe even, plus 3 or so more songs from that Artist that Spotify Algorithm deems I would like or suit my taste, even if it's NOT a popular song or it's released a long time ago, but might help convince me to like that Artist enough to decide to Follow. 
If there's a way to specify/customize each of those numbers, of how many songs of each categories [Popular/RecentSingles/RecentAlbums/SpotifyThinksYouMightLike] to add to my Other Playlists/Queue, that'd be great. Maybe something like a scrolling number, like how UI in choosing a number of hours/minutes/seconds for a Timer/Alarm, those kinds of UI.",2,9.0.32,2025-04-16T23:08:17-07:00,id,2025-05-14 17:27:02

kannaboso69,Inconsistent UI,"The UI in Spotify isn't user friendly, mainly because of useless thing (like shorts/reel vids in Spotify) and i can tell that the user library management isn't being put too much thought into, because its way too general (you only have favorite and the rest is custom). Should've created algorithm that can both generate and recommend playlist that are custom made for unique user. Having a ""if you like x artist, then you must like yzw artists"" type of playlist doesn't help either. For me personally, it's not hitting even the slightest vibe and that's such a shame for a big music app like Spotify. Not to mention the inconsistent features on different OS, oh it's such a headache. I feel like i can ramble about the application quality on this app but that would take forever.

bdujbxyu,Spotify's Local File Sync Is a Nightmare ‚Äî Especially for Audiobooks,"Spotify's local file sync feature is an absolute nightmare. I spent hours trying to get MP3 files ‚Äî clean, properly tagged, even re-encoded ‚Äî to sync from my Mac to my iPhone. The process sounds simple: add local files, create a playlist, download the playlist on your phone. Except it doesn't work.

The playlist shows up on iPhone. The files show up. The ""Download"" toggle flips. But nothing actually downloads. Try to play the file? You get:

""Song not downloaded. If you own the song, you can sync it from your computer.""

Well ‚Äî I do own the file. I am trying to sync it from my computer. But Spotify refuses.

I stripped embedded artwork, cleaned metadata, re-encoded the files using FFmpeg, created fresh playlists, used new folders, reinstalled the app, rebooted the phone, used the same Wi-Fi, Nothing works.

And all of this while I'm paying top dollar for Spotify Premium.

To make things worse, I couldn't even find playback speed controls ‚Äî let alone pitch correction ‚Äî which is pretty standard in audiobook players. I gave up and switched to BookPlayer: it's free, open source, has proper speed controls with pitch correction, and importing files takes literal seconds.

Spotify is ok for streaming music, but if you're trying to listen to your own audiobooks or personal audio on mobile ‚Äî look elsewhere. This feature is broken and unsupported, and clearly not a priority.",1,9.0.28,2025-03-25T14:33:38-07:00,nl,2025-05-14 17:27:02

jo-ry,"ok, but not more","The UI is designed for people who don't have their own taste of music and who listen whatever the ""intelligence"" of spotify wants them to listen. 
Whatever I listen, spotify keeps adding horrible music by changing the style of music I'm listening. This ""intelligence"" is meant to unify the style of music people listen, it makes music more mainstream and more boring. 
For audiobooks and podcasts spotify is one of the worst players you could imagine. I strongly suggest to use a podcast player for podcasts, there is much more comfort. Of course spotify nudges you to listen to podcasts, because they don't pay the podcasters while it costs them money if you listen to music. 
The spotify originals are rather bad productions - content is secondary, sound effects and simplicity go first.
The app is gerting worse and worse. Lately they added videos that flicker around everywhere - ugly and annoying.",1,9.0.32,2025-04-12T22:34:35-07:00,ch,2025-05-14 17:27:02

Queerly,Miserable experience,"I've stopped using the app. I stopped Spotify premium subscription some time ago, I just wasn't using it often enough to warrant the expense. All was good for a while, the adds were a bit annoying at times, especially when they play the same add twice in a row, but I think that's on purpose to make it as irritating as possible for non-paying users, which is fair game. Lately, in my region, they've started playing adds asking for donations for war refugees. I understand the good cause, but - like most people - I listen to music to relax and escape the reality, and constantly being reminded about the misery out there in the world defeats the purpose. I do not want to diminish the tragedy of what the people suffering from the atrocities from war are going through, but having those adds repeated after every 3 songs is somewhat triggering. And it's not like the adds go away once you donate, since I already donate regularly to charitable causes. The only way to make them go away is to ""donate"" to Spotify. I don't mind ads like that for news apps or YouTube and such like, but on Spotify they feel out of touch. I think Spotify should curate their adds better.",3,9.0.0,2024-12-17T03:07:07-07:00,ch,2025-05-14 17:27:02

deodorant isana candy sky,18+ content,"First of all, I really enjoy this app, love the podcasts, songs and everything. But something about this app is VERY wrong. You see, on podcasts (video and audio) there is a lot of UNCOVERED sus content that is in any way not for kids. And here I mean LGBTQ+ content, 18+ content and stuff like that. And you might think it's fine... If you do you probably need a brain replacement, because these types of videos are uncovered and anybody can see it, including kids. Imagine a little kid scrolling through spotify that can't read, for example looking for a song like Baby Shark and an 18+ video that someone posted on their podcast pops up and that kid clicks it... They're gonna be traumatized for the rest of their life. I'm sorry, but why is that type of content considered for 'All ages'?

Another thing are ads. I have Spotify Premium now, but I don't want people who don't have it to suffer thru this much ads. i'm talking about 2 ads every 4 songs. When you dislike an ad it automatically shows you even MORE ads!

Overall the app is very good but please do something about these things I talked about.

player#duck,The is music app doesn't allow you to play music,"As in the title. On free version after searching for a song you get apparently switched to a random different song from the same playlist. The song that you originally searched for is there but you need to wait or skip to get to it. And as the number of skips per hour is limited you actually need to wait‚Ä¶
I of course understand that free version needs to have some limitations. But for it to be a limitation to the basic music player feature of actually playing a song is just ridiculous. 
So be warned that in the free version Spotify is just a parody of a music player.",1,9.0.18,2025-02-15T06:59:09-07:00,pl,2025-05-14 17:27:02
rojbos,free version is useless,"this is the worst app you can find if you want to listen to music for free without paying money. if you have free version of spotify and you want to for example listen to one song you really like, you just can't because then you need to listen a few random songs and then after you listen to this random songs you will hear after 10 minutes the song that you wanted to listen before, but if you don't want to listen to the other songs, you can skip it so why there is a problem? problem is because you can skip song 6 TIMES PER HOUR which is absurd‚Ä¶
another problem with free version is that you have one or two ads every 10-15 minutes and its so annoying, the only good reason to listen music on spotify is because they have spotify wrapped, idk why people are using spotify, like bro, there is so many free music aps that are much better, people just using this because its popular",1,9.0.18,2025-02-14T08:17:47-07:00,pl,2025-05-14 17:27:02

Service: you can chose what quality to to stream in, highest is good enough for almost all uses. Lets you download lists and listen offline. 

App:
sometimes the team add/remove or relocate functions without explanation and to some subjective annoyance. 
Silly problems like if you use enhanced playlist, you cant ""swipe"" to que a song, only click for the drop down menu, makikg me not use enhanced playlist despite liking the idea.

Listening session that you can invite people to is also great but needs some fine tuning and sync tuning.",4,9.0.40,2025-05-05T01:32:06-07:00,dk,2025-05-14 17:27:02

Marianne N√∏rr,Feed back,"Hej Spotify. Jeg har i mange √•r benytte mig af Deezer. For at samle vores k√∏b af musik til et sted (b√∏rnene vandt) fik min mand og jeg ogs√• Spotify.
Det er et godt produkt, men fra Deezer, savner jeg, at jeg jeg med f√¶rre ""klik"" kan gemme en sang og derved meget hurtigere kan lave en playliste. Jeg synes ogs√• overskueligheden med min mange playlister var bedre ved Deezer. 

Hvis jeg skal v√¶lge en sang under ""numre/sange"", s√• synes jeg ikke at alle kunstnerens sange fremg√•r. Der skal jeg ind under ""album"" for at lede. Jeg synes ogs√• at en og samme sang bliver vist flere gange, i stedet for kun √©n gang. Jeg mener selvf√∏lgelig ikke en sang som er lavet i forskellige genre.

Jeg har ogs√• oplevet at hvis jeg KUN vil h√∏re Phil Collins, s√• mikser Spotify, en anden kunstner ind efter ca hvert 3. nummer??

Ellers super fedt at I oplyser om koncerter og nye sange fra de kunstnere som jeg har som favoritter.

I m√• gerne kontakte mig, hvis jeg skal uddybe.

Imagine a world where every melody ever composed, every beat ever dropped, and every lyric ever penned is right at your fingertips. That world exists‚Äîand it's called Spotify.

Spotify isn't just an app; it's a revolution. It's my personal DJ, a time machine to my childhood hits, and the curator of my future favorites. Its algorithm knows me better than I know myself, weaving playlists that feel like they're plucked straight from my soul. Whether I'm running, working, partying, or just needing a moment to breathe, Spotify provides the perfect soundtrack every time.

The user interface? Sleek and intuitive. The sound quality? Crystal-clear magic. And let's talk about Discover Weekly‚Äîit's not just a playlist; it's an adventure! Every Monday feels like Christmas morning as I unwrap new songs to fall in love with.

Spotify has turned silent car rides into karaoke nights, dull workouts into adrenaline-pumping sessions, and quiet evenings into deep, introspective journeys. It's more than an app; it's a lifestyle.

If music is the universal language, Spotify is its most eloquent translator. Download it, and I guarantee it'll be the best decision you've ever made. Bravo, Spotify! üëè

The audio quality on Apple Music is superior, and by a big margin. I have heard of spotify adding many features that Apple Music still doesn't have and i still don't care. Oh and btw!

Nick17689,Excessive Sponsored Recomendations in Spotify Premium,"I've been using the premium version of this app for quite some time, but I've recently noticed a significant increase in sponsored recommendations. One of the main reasons I subscribed to the spotify premium was to avoid excessive ads and distractions. However, it feels like the number of sponsored content has dramatically grown, which reduces the value of the premium experience.

While I understand that some sponsored content might be necessary, the current amount seems excessive, especially for paying subscribers. I would appreciate it if this issue could be reconsidered to ensure that premium users receive the ad-free or low-ad experience they're paying for.",1,8.9.76,2024-09-27T06:37:58-07:00,at,2025-05-14 17:27:02

This is a horrible App design because I always have to listen to the same 50 songs or so even tough there are 300+ in the Playlist. Example: If I click on Lose Yourself in the playlist the second song is always Wiener Blut and the third one is Garbo and the fourth one is Crying on the Dancefloor and so on.,1,8.9.74,2024-09-13T09:41:43-07:00,at,2025-05-14 17:27:02

Nusti4,"Nice app, but some issues with (smart) shuffle features","I like the app, but in my opinion the shuffle option needs some improvements. Every time I want to listen songs in shuffle option, so that they are randomly played, they are always played according the same ""shuffle"" order. 
The same goes for smart shuffle. Only sometimes I get new songs recommendations when listening in smart shuffle, but mostly I hear the same songs all over. I am really struggling when I want to listen to something new (but similar to my playlist songs), which I believe is the main goal of the smart shuffle.
Could you please somehow improve an algorithms of the shuffle and smart shuffle options so that the songs are properly mixed and not played the same all the time?

LaKy1344,Crazy in 2025,"Spotify is great if you're just a passive listener. But the moment you try to build your own music system, it stops making sense.
	‚Ä¢	I can't share my ""Liked Songs"" playlist? Why? It's literally just a list of songs I like ‚Äî and I can't send it to anyone. So I have to create a private playlist and manually add the same songs there. And here comes the next issue:
	‚Ä¢	I can't easily add a new song with one click. When I hit ""Add to playlist"", it automatically goes to ""Liked Songs"". And no, I can't set a different playlist as my main one. Why is that not an option?
	‚Ä¢	Sorting by ""date added"" only works on the phone, not on PC. Why doesn't this basic feature work across devices?
	‚Ä¢	The same playlist looks completely different on different devices ‚Äî layout, colors, sorting. I control playback from my phone and listen on my PC, but each device shows it differently. What is that about?

Spotify, are you doing this on purpose? It's no longer a streaming service ‚Äî it's a logic puzzle to work around your own UX. And I'm losing.

RizzDoge,There's no way they have done it,"I thought that Spotify free couldn't get more useless but now they have done it. Normally you could listen to your music on playlist on shuffle and couldn't choose which one to play. But now. Oh boy. You can't ever listen to the music on the SHUFFLE?!! You can only play one random song from a playlist and after lt ends you can't listen anymore. There is a way around this tho. If you have to playlists you can just switch between them after every song. But that is INCREDIBLY ANNOYING AND UNUSABLE!!!! WHY WOULD YOU MAKE THIS??? The premium is goated but IT IS SO EXPENSIVE!!!! I have my most loved and hand made playlists there. If I can't listen to them no more, I think I will actually switch to something else and use some tool to transfer the playlists. Because this app is not totally UNUSABLE well unless you pay.

rgjtfbjji,Great until you need their customer service,"I lost money to their customer service and also my whole family and I couldn't use our family plan because of some mistake with the app. The customer service didn't help me, I chatted with 7 advisors at least, everybody had a different idea, but they didn't resolve my issue so far. We had to create new profiles on Spotify, because our former profiles couldn't join a premium plan twice a year. (And that would be understandable, but my first premium account stopped working and they ADVISED me to leave it and create another one haha.) My last chat with them took 3 hours with 4 different advisors who just kept me waiting and it ended with escalation to ""specialised team"". They reached me via mail to tell me that there is nothing they can do for me, but they can assure me, that they CAN SEE that my family members created new profiles and joined the family plan already, so there is actually no issue anymore. I really dont understand their behaviour and motivation. Or maybe I do - Spotify has no competition, so they know you don't have anywhere to leave, and that is why they don't have to worry with your concerns.

- Unnecessary bloat like TikTok home feed or videos or the Add Playlist button in the dock now
- No feature parity: You can't rearrange playlists in the mobile app, you can't create folders and you can't play folders either. You need the web app for all these - but if you access the web app from mobile, Spotify will block access to these features in favour of touting their incapable, bare-bones mobile app that can't do the very things I'm trying to use the web app for üòá",2,8.9.94,2024-11-26T03:18:58-07:00,hu,2025-05-14 17:27:02

H-k-k,Be more transparent,"1. Searching the update history and I only can see a typical update message in all of your versions. Why not be transparent on what you release with each version so we know your new features? 
2. Endless list of features within the app, nothing advertised or communicated to the user. E.g today was the first time I see the Sleeper timer feature. Not sure where this got there. 
3. Adding a song to favorites. I mean the hi should be pretty easy, a heart (like you used to have) or a star. Common pattern in every app. The plus icon is confusing, I am still struggling to find it and searching for the heart one every single time. 
4. Leaving feedback for the product within the app. Shouldn't this be more accessible? I still have not find it, this is why I leave my feedback here.",5,8.9.70,2024-09-08T00:16:01-07:00,gr,2025-05-14 17:27:02

But there are simply some people who cannot pay for the Premium version, mainly because they do not have the money for it. So why make things even more difficult for us Free users? I understand that you want your app to become successful. However, it will just decrease the amount of people using the app. I myself am thinking of deleting the app for good, after you guys set a limit for lyrics. I heard you are also going to add a song limit. I am just switching apps if I cannot enjoy my playlists in peace.",3,8.9.42,2024-05-29T21:24:07-07:00,gr,2025-05-14 17:27:02

nastarev,this is sad,"i thought that spotify would be the app that everyone needed after all these years to finally organize our music library. i feel like it's more of a toy than a serious application. and even worse a toy that does not respect the musicians, which would be really vital for an app like this to respect the creators.
in its use there are not all the necessary info about each song available to the user. even dates are not easy to find if there are any. the navigation is kind of crappy. the liked songs are not affecting a lot anything in the app and it would be important to do so. also the app is not giving me feedback on the followed artist, its like i never liked them.. and it is really important for the artists to be followed as this represents how many people are into them.this is a really hot variable these days, for good or for bad.this fact should be a reason to make the user want to follow a musician, chase the artist and this should be returned back to the user, reward him for following. now there no visible difference if i follow someone or not. the app does not even lead me to the artists i like. also when im on tv and playing a song i cannot visit the musician's page!i can only follow or unfollow. are there ways ro organize the artist i follow?why is there no information about when i liked each artist?or how many times have i heard each song maybe?the list goes on and on.it is a really poor app with unfortunately great significance in the music industry. thus it should be taken more seriously with respect to the user and the artist.",1,8.9.14,2024-02-17T11:40:55-07:00,gr,2025-05-14 17:27:02

BreakHolloway,Poor experience,"An app where music in playlists doesn't sync properly between devices. If you add or remove music on one device, it may not sync on another for weeks, and the solutions on the website don't help.

How is it possible that a subscription-based app doesn't offer a way to report bugs or get direct support? The only option is to visit the website and leave a ""review"" there, without receiving any notifications directly in the app.

What kind of ridiculous method is this for verifying a paid family subscription? Why require an address for confirmation when this could be an optional feature instead of mandatory? For example, alternative verification methods could be added, or the requirement could be removed entirely.

- The Apple Watch app also has poor synchronization sometimes it can't even load half of a playlist.",1,9.0.30,2025-04-01T02:44:15-07:00,il,2025-05-14 17:27:02

Big ballin no.1,Too money hungry,"Don't do my mistake of using Spotify I can't change now cause too many songs and playlists now I'm gonna talk about the issues first 6 skips per hour like I don't wanna listen to American boy when I'm down and monthly limit on how many times I can check the lyrics I now can't hear the lyrics even if my life depended on it the heck do you mean monthly limit and now they added monthly limit to how many times you can listen to a song like when I like a song it's gonna be on repeat for the whole week It will be like the only I wanna hear and any other song won't do the trick the limit is like 80 the hell am I gonna do with only 80 times a 30 minute walk at most and don't say to listen to on YouTube I can listen to music while working all I'm saying is the Spotify wrapped isn't worth it to the user and to Spotify you guys are too greedy to the point you're making people switch apps what's the point of doing all this think about it if someone is having a bad day and they can't listen to the song they want your making it worse but at the end of the day you couldn't care about that cause the only thing on your mind is money.

For example, you can now ""save"" songs to a list, like Pinterest, which is fine. However, things start to get interesting when clicking on playlists. When clicking on most of Spotify's playlists, you are met with a prompt: to ""scroll through the songs."" After clicking on this prompt, you are greeted by, essentially, a musical version of TikTok. You are given thirty seconds of a song from the playlist (usually the chorus) with a video overlay, hashtags, and buttons on the side to share, like, etc. At any time, you can swipe down, and are greeted with a 30 second snippet of the catchiest part of the next song. This horrifies me: let me talk about why.

Before we talk about Spotify, let's set up some context. We all know that albums are dying. Among other things, it mainly has to do with attention spans. Most don't have the time to listen to a full album. 90% of people only listen to individual songs. But some people also don't have the time to listen to a whole song. If they don't know a song yet, they might only listen to 10 seconds before judging. If they already know the song, they may often skip to the best part. We've seen this with TikTok virality: a song can top the charts with 99% of people only having listened to the best 20 seconds of it. In response, hits are getting much shorter, too. But what does this have to do with Spotify's new TikTok-like feature?

Well, now people can listen to all their music this way. Instead of listening to a song all the way through, Spotify can skip to the best thirty seconds of it for you. At any time, too, you can swipe down if the first 5 seconds of a song haven't caught your interest. The biggest failure of music platforms in recent times is not letting listeners be able to just listen to the one part they want to. If there's a viral TikTok song someone loves, they can't just listen to that part. They have to slog through the ENTIRE two-and-a-half minute song if they want to hear those twenty seconds they like! TWO AND A HALF MINUTES? WHO HAS TIME FOR THAT!? Spotify has become the first platform to fix this fault, and as others follow suit, people might not have the attention spans to listen to not just a full album, but a full song. Of course, I might be crazy. But the unsettling thing is: this very well might happen. And if short-form context keeps growing bigger, attention spans keep getting smaller, and song snippets keep going viral, it will happen. Death to the song. Wait and see.

TL,DR: As attention spans shrink and twenty-second audio clips go viral, people won't want to slog through the rest of the song just to hear the part they like. A new Spotify feature lets them listen to only their favorite thirty seconds instead of the whole song, and just like albums, songs may die too.",1,9.0.0,2024-12-15T05:17:55-07:00,ae,2025-05-14 17:27:02

LG_DXB,No support for Shortcuts,"Apple Music is pulling ahead of Spotify in terms of functionality and convenience, by virtue of Shortcuts alone. A growing trend amongst iOS users is the use of Shortcuts and custom widgets to customise their devices in a legit way - Spotify is being left behind due to their refusal to give even basic Shortcuts support/integration. There are thousands and thousands of shortcuts out there that call for a music player, and they are all forced to default to Apple Music. Thousands and thousands of custom widgets that are forced to integrate with Apple Music (often via Shortcuts).",1,8.9.96,2024-12-10T19:19:57-07:00,ae,2025-05-14 17:27:02

The issue is that we all travel frequently for work, and now we can't even use the app, because it ""detects"" that we're not in the country. üò°
What's worse is that Spotify refuses to issue a refund, despite the fact that we're paying for a service we can't access. Very disappointed with the lack of flexibility and customer support! üò°üò°üò°",1,8.9.76,2024-09-19T09:05:47-07:00,ae,2025-05-14 17:27:02

Best to Better ‚ú®,A recommendation !!!,"Hey ,Spotify I was just wondering some ideas for improvements üòä‚ò∫Ô∏è ‚Ä¶. So I have noted some songs going to the lyrics well.. about them that some of them are in a different language ? Correct? I was wondering if you could possibly make a section in the lyrics area that you press/swipe or something and you could translate the Lyrics to a different language . For like K-pop fans or Hindi songs and more .Some who knows the cultural language but don't understand the writing when they read the lyric or they don't know the song or understand it .The can go to the lyric section and change it to a language they understand so instead of going to a different app or something they can do it there plus it keeps their time more up on the app. Thanks Spotify hope you use this it's helpful it would help me and everyone else who agrees !!",5,8.9.74,2024-09-17T06:30:07-07:00,ae,2025-05-14 17:27:02

Ssophos,Spotify is getting worse every year,"Spotify used to be a great app for free music, with the occasional ad. Now, everything is premium and reeks of corporate greed.

Everything is soulless and is ""powered"" by AI. Playlists full of AI generated music gets recommended and shoved into your face 24/7 by Spotify, which is so ridiculous because instead of actually talented HUMAN artists receiving money, Spotify gets to keep everything and force you to listen to trash and repetitive regurgitated AI slop that they call ""music"". 

Instead of writing their own genres for Spotify wrapped (what used to be a fun and original Christmas special showcasing everything you've listened to throughout the year), they just generated random prompts and took all of the soul out of it.

As a premium user, Spotify isn't even good if you pay them. It's the same trash that I just mentioned, minus the excessive ads and being able to download songs.

Spotify, bring back the soul. Make your app creative and fun again.",2,9.0.40,2025-05-09T04:47:29-07:00,za,2025-05-14 17:27:02

Bhuti Pat,Good app but not enough for a market leader,"Have been using Spotify for a very long time now. 
It's overall a good app however there is two things that really haven't gotten much better, or even worse, over time. One is that the music recommendations and ""radios"" are basically always playing the same songs and bands - rarely that something new comes up. Quite boring.
The second thing is, and that really really goes on my nerves, that whether on my phone or on my laptop the app just is unable to play very often. It just hangs and I need to restart it. It's like there is no internet - but there is. This happens multiple times a week and it's an absolute joke.",3,9.0.32,2025-04-16T07:34:53-07:00,za,2025-05-14 17:27:02

The Seacow,Dumb Shuffle,"The smart shuffle feature can be a great way to find new songs but functions strangely by playing a predetermined selection of songs depending on which song you start with in your playlist. So it doesn't actually shuffle randomly. It also seems to only shuffle from certain sections depending on where you start it in a playlist if you have a lot of songs in the playlist like your Liked Songs playlist. 

Sponsored recommendations are awful and borderline paid for ads from artists trying to get noticed. Regardless of your tastes or genres they will get pushed in your face based on your country and will not be to your tastes at all. I get better artist recommendations on Spotify in Instagram ads which is a joke. 

The AI DJ is‚Ä¶yeah. Just no. There is no intelligence there at all. Just lazily pushing genres and top artists based on your location again instead of finding you new music based on your actual tastes and listening history. Gave up trying to train it and repeatedly hiding the same artists and songs I don't like. 

Daily mixes have become incredibly lazy to the point where even when you ""hide"" a song in the playlist it will refresh with the same song still hidden 2 days later with all the same artists in the same order. Also, downloaded songs and albums that are classified as ""liked"" songs even though they don't appear in your ""liked songs"" playlist is confusing and stupid.",3,9.0.26,2025-03-15T01:57:06-07:00,za,2025-05-14 17:27:02

Other than that I'm please overall. It's lit. Try it. Don't just settle for free mode, go straight to premium and enjoy all the peaks. Why have a bite or snack when you can have the whole meal?",5,9.0.20,2025-02-27T00:52:01-07:00,za,2025-05-14 17:27:02

GrumpyGrouper,I just wish it would work properly.,"Honestly, for what it tries (or tried) to do, Spotify is great. I've had some great artists recommended to me by the algorithms, and the aesthetic of the app is fantastic. The true shame lies in the fact that the app's core functionality as an audio streaming platform is becoming increasingly sidelined with each update. I have been having more issues (freezes, song skipping, song fast-forwarding, audio artefacts, difficulty pairing to Bluetooth) seemingly with every update. These are issues that are not exclusive to me and my device, for everyone that I know who uses Spotify has reported the same issues independently.  
It's just a pity to see, what was once my favourite app, be systematically butchered. I don't care about your stupid ""Spotify wrapped"", I just want the app to work consistently, that's all.
Oh yes, and added a star because the ""Jam"" feature is pretty cool.

I searched it up on google and google said it was because I didn't have Spotify premium. In that case, my other device is working like Spotify premium without me paying!

 I have been a paid subscriber for many many years now, reaching over 2500 songs in my library and playlists alone. I have recently moved over to Apple Music and probably won't resubscribe again to Spotify unless the issue can be fixed.

‚ú®ellie (taylor's version)‚ú®,Spotify Review,i love spotify. i use it pretty much everyday for listening to my music and it's one of my favourite apps. it's got all the best singers and musicians of history. the one annoying thing is for the non-premium users it has many ads you can't skip and only six skips an hour. this is annoying because if you accidentally skip a song you've wasted a skip and if i don't use all my skips- say i use three skips- then i will only have three skips the next hour. other than that spotify is my go-to for music and i love it! thank you for reading!,4,8.9.82,2024-10-20T12:04:01-07:00,nz,2025-05-14 17:27:02

ScottyStewart,Premium still has ads,"I pay for premium. So I don't listen to ads. Spotify podcasts, made by them, have ads. Which I have to listen to, despite paying not too. Apparently this is in their T&Cs. I don't care. That's misleading and lying to your customers. I tried to complain, I got through to a bot. They don't care about you.",1,8.9.76,2024-09-19T18:29:11-07:00,nz,2025-05-14 17:27:02

118143184,"""SPONSORED RECOMMENDATIONS"" ON PREMIUM","GTFO WITH ALL THESE SPONSORED RECOMMENDATIONS! what is all this sponsored recommendation business. They keep finding excuses to litter your home page with ads even when you pay for premium. They let you hide them but how about just get rid of them entirely or get better at personalising recommendations. If you don't already use Spotify, get YouTube premium or something else instead!",1,8.9.74,2024-09-14T18:20:38-07:00,nz,2025-05-14 17:27:02

andre 898,"It's good, but there are better alternatives","While the design and features are impressive, I'm disappointed by two major drawbacks. Firstly, the audio quality feels outdated, especially considering it's 2024 and the platform still only supports MP3. Secondly, the company's apparent lack of support for artists is concerning.

Competitors like Tidal have similar features, but with CD and higher audio quality and also pay artists fairly.",3,8.9.70,2024-09-06T12:04:08-07:00,nz,2025-05-14 17:27:02
