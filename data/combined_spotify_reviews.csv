9,DontaBuya,"The only way to not be plagued with multiple advertisements between every song you listen to is paying for the premium version. This wouldn't be an issue if it were a few ads every once and awhile right? Wrong. If you have Spotify free for whatever reason, you will hear no less than 4 ads after every song. You will hear more advertisements then actual music. When your ""Spotify wrapped"" comes out in November, it should actually show; 1. Draft Kings, 2.

14,Joey @sassygamergirl,"Ok so my friend doesn't have premium and I do and not having premium can be ultra annoying. First every like 5 or 6 songs there is an ad and it gets to be annoying. Next, you can't just pick a so g to play. You have to pick a playlist and a random song plays. I personally think you should be able to pick whatever song you choose. Lastly, premium is just way better than non premium and I think you should add some options to non premium that just aren't fair to have them on premium but not have them on non premium. These are the things. Number 1, non premium members should be able to pick whatever song they please. Number 2, adds you get in between songs, the number of songs in between each ad is ALWAYS randomized. Sometimes it is 8 songs or 2 or 5 etc. make it a specific number like 5 or 10. This is my review.

15,Rpgalltheway,"Spotify knows they keep making their product worse and worse, they have to know, they get bombarded with suggestions and requests because heavens forbid any tech company actually field real support and feedback, let's just leave it up to blogs and forums and let the consumers do the thinking for us. It seems Spotify has fully embraced the asinine trends of terrible US tech companies like Meta and Amazon.

I was finally prompted to actually write a review because of the most recent display update that added the annoying create button in the spot where Library used to be. Library is the primary screen most people use, and now the screen real estate is messed up for what reason? To put all the social features in one inconvenient place? I never have and never will want to use any of the create tools, and guess what they were all fine exactly where they were, never had any trouble finding them before. 

I also don't want to keep paying an increased subscription price for an app that can't load downloaded content correctly when the network is congested. There doesn't seem to be the common sense feature that if network speeds do not meet a certain threshold then toggle offline mode so people can still access offline content appropriately. Instead of having a bloated app that consumes too many resources that essentially crashes when the network speeds are good enough to navigate everything on the app but not good enough stream, making it so you still somehow can't access downloaded content because streaming can't happen and offline mode has to be toggled on to access it.

I also don't want to pay for audiobooks I never listen to, if you're trying to poach Audible subscribers the answer was to not subsidize the feature by making it seem like a beneficial extra to the base subscription and then upping the price. Make a music+audiobook subscription tier and have it cost $2 more than the base premium. Same with the new video hosting, I don't want to pay for Spotify's new video hosting servers, I want a dedicated quality music app and now the vision is clearly gone.

The only people that want what Spotify is currently doing are the executives that can get more money from even the worst ideas (because somehow even terribly implemented features = increased subscription price) and the people who believe them when they get told these are all good things. The amount of good ideas and feature requests and feature removal requests (looking at you smart shuffle) completely ignored on the forums exemplify that Spotify clearly does not care. 

All these features should be opt-in/toggle-able at the very least, and removed immediately for others.

This is a great time to start supporting artists directly, purchasing tracks so you can have them forever, and not rely on companies that make things consistently worse to dictate your experiences.",spotify knows keep making product worse worse know get bombarded suggestions requests heavens forbid tech company actually field real support feedback let leave blogs forums let consumers thinking us seems spotify fully embraced asinine trends terrible us tech companies like meta amazon finally prompted actually write review recent display update added annoying create button spot library used library primary screen people use screen real estate messed reason put social features one inconvenient place never never want use create tools guess fine exactly never trouble finding also want keep paying increased subscription price app load downloaded content correctly network congested seem common sense feature network speeds meet certain threshold toggle offline mode people still access offline content appropriately instead bloated app consumes many resources essentially crashes network speeds good enough navigate everything app good enough stream making still somehow access downloaded content streaming happen offline mode toggled access also want pay audiobooks never listen trying poach audible subscribers answer subsidize feature making seem like beneficial extra base subscription upping price make music audiobook subscription tier cost base premium new video hosting want pay spotify new video hosting servers want dedicated quality music app vision clearly gone people want spotify currently executives get money even worst ideas somehow even terribly implemented features increased subscription price people believe get told good things amount good ideas feature requests feature removal requests looking smart shuffle completely ignored forums exemplify spotify clearly care features opt toggle able least removed immediately others great time start supporting artists directly purchasing tracks forever rely companies make things consistently worse dictate experiences,1,9.0.40,2025-05-13T17:50:37-07:00,2025-05-15 16:01:10,apple_store

188,Hannah Soules,"I've used this app for several years. I don't pay for premium, and I've never really minded the ads. Sometimes it'll give you four ads back to back and then promise you 30 minutes of ad-free listening, only to play you an ad after the next couple of songs. That's super annoying and is why I docked a star. But it doesn't happen all the time. After the most recent update (Dec 2024?), it would only play one song and then stop completely.

192,Laela Overmoyer,"The music and audiobook features are fantastic, but the podcast features are awful.
