DontaBuya,Most greedy app I've used,"The only way to not be plagued with multiple advertisements between every song you listen to is paying for the premium version. This wouldn't be an issue if it were a few ads every once and awhile right? Wrong. If you have Spotify free for whatever reason, you will hear no less than 4 ads after every song. You will hear more advertisements then actual music. When your ""Spotify wrapped"" comes out in November, it should actually show; 1. Draft Kings, 2. ""WHOOPS dID i JuSt iNTeRuPt yOuR jAm sEssIOn"" 3. Random podcasters you've never heard of pushing their stream, 4. Random artists you've never heard of pushing their albums, 5. ""Dun dun, dun dun dun dun, dun dun dun dun"" (the last one is draft kings again) because the entire free side of the app is nothing but ads. Go listen to the radio. Because you might not get to hear exactly what you want, but at least their will be less ads, and less obnoxious ads. Whistle a tune or hum a song from memory. Save yourself the headache of hearing absolute mind numbing garbage.",1,9.0.40,2025-05-13T18:04:16-07:00,us,2025-05-15 14:30:17

Joey @sassygamergirl,This app is amazing!!!,"Ok so my friend doesn't have premium and I do and not having premium can be ultra annoying. First every like 5 or 6 songs there is an ad and it gets to be annoying. Next, you can't just pick a so g to play. You have to pick a playlist and a random song plays. I personally think you should be able to pick whatever song you choose. Lastly, premium is just way better than non premium and I think you should add some options to non premium that just aren't fair to have them on premium but not have them on non premium. These are the things. Number 1, non premium members should be able to pick whatever song they please. Number 2, adds you get in between songs, the number of songs in between each ad is ALWAYS randomized. Sometimes it is 8 songs or 2 or 5 etc. make it a specific number like 5 or 10. This is my review. You probably didn't stay t9 the end but if you are reading this right now thank you! And get premium it is so much better!!

Rpgalltheway,They Keep Making It Worse,"Spotify knows they keep making their product worse and worse, they have to know, they get bombarded with suggestions and requests because heavens forbid any tech company actually field real support and feedback, let's just leave it up to blogs and forums and let the consumers do the thinking for us. It seems Spotify has fully embraced the asinine trends of terrible US tech companies like Meta and Amazon.

I was finally prompted to actually write a review because of the most recent display update that added the annoying create button in the spot where Library used to be. Library is the primary screen most people use, and now the screen real estate is messed up for what reason? To put all the social features in one inconvenient place? I never have and never will want to use any of the create tools, and guess what they were all fine exactly where they were, never had any trouble finding them before. 

I also don't want to keep paying an increased subscription price for an app that can't load downloaded content correctly when the network is congested. There doesn't seem to be the common sense feature that if network speeds do not meet a certain threshold then toggle offline mode so people can still access offline content appropriately. Instead of having a bloated app that consumes too many resources that essentially crashes when the network speeds are good enough to navigate everything on the app but not good enough stream, making it so you still somehow can't access downloaded content because streaming can't happen and offline mode has to be toggled on to access it.

I also don't want to pay for audiobooks I never listen to, if you're trying to poach Audible subscribers the answer was to not subsidize the feature by making it seem like a beneficial extra to the base subscription and then upping the price. Make a music+audiobook subscription tier and have it cost $2 more than the base premium. Same with the new video hosting, I don't want to pay for Spotify's new video hosting servers, I want a dedicated quality music app and now the vision is clearly gone.

The only people that want what Spotify is currently doing are the executives that can get more money from even the worst ideas (because somehow even terribly implemented features = increased subscription price) and the people who believe them when they get told these are all good things. The amount of good ideas and feature requests and feature removal requests (looking at you smart shuffle) completely ignored on the forums exemplify that Spotify clearly does not care. 

All these features should be opt-in/toggle-able at the very least, and removed immediately for others.

This is a great time to start supporting artists directly, purchasing tracks so you can have them forever, and not rely on companies that make things consistently worse to dictate your experiences.",1,9.0.40,2025-05-13T17:50:37-07:00,us,2025-05-15 14:30:17

mda2347,So many glitches,"I really want to love this app, but it has frequent unneeded design updates, causing bugs and glitches when it was good the way it was. In addition to a create button on the bottom right that was never asked for, the ui designer decided to also move ""offline mode"" to a different section. Offline mode is so buggy that it turns itself off constantly, within less than 12 hours of turning it on. Please focus on fixing the design of your app instead of unnecessary changes and adding in features like ig stories-like discovery sections and ""create"" buttons that mimic social media apps like Instagram and tiktok. Spotify is a music app and should function as one first, not try to become a social media app and play in a lane that it doesn't belong in.",2,9.0.40,2025-05-13T17:21:32-07:00,us,2025-05-15 14:30:17

DSMSDBFORCEDS,"Spotify as of May, 2025","I have been paying for Premium around nine years. Spotify wants to be a social media platform. Years ago, I used its algorithm as a discovery engine. It was decent. The fake AI stuff snuck up on me, and now Spotify feels as overrun with AI entities as Meta or any other dangerous internet space. It's starting to feel like a vanity publication. Artists, contributors, content providers be aware you're paying a social media platform to use your creative work any way it can. For these reasons, I don't see Spotify as creator, artist, or podcaster friendly. I don't think Joe Rogan pays for Spotify Creator or whatever the podcast product is now called. Spotify is still worth the approximately ten dollars per month I now pay  but if a similar app comes along that doesn't want to be another everything app like Meta, WeChat, or Amazon I might be jumping ship then.",2,9.0.40,2025-05-13T10:05:28-07:00,us,2025-05-15 14:30:17

Poignant Bubble,"10 Years Ago, to Now.","Spotify, 

Next month, I will be walking away after 10 years with Spotify, because of poor choice after poor choice made by the Spotify team. Since having premium, i haven't listened to ads in 5 years, and after reading recent reviews it seems that those of us who have Free receive more ads than music. The whole ""30 minutes of ad free music"" followed by an ad 5 minutes later was happening 5 years ago too by the way. For one of the top two music apps in the world, with millions of users, you might think that the ads given would be justifiably less intrusive than they have to be, but Spotify has proven to be much more about profit than user experience. In the last year, i have noticed at least 7 major changes to the app interface, none of which has made my experience as a customer any easier. My humble onion, it started going downhill when you changed your font last year. As a long time user, of course i noticed. it bothered me, but it wasn't too much to bear. Fast forward to now, and i've even noticed a bug on the screen when opening the new ""add"" feature. Beloved Spotify employees. Why fix what ain't broke? Why make such bad choices when apple music pays artists more, and doesn't change UI that's been the same for 10+ years? Not everything needs an update, especially when people have been asking for you to bring back dated playlists and different 'sort by' options. I never, ever thought i'd change sides after going through ""Spotify vs Apple Music"" in HS. I always thought Spotify was superior, and I was wrong. I consider myself to be an A+ Spotify user, with 10 years and almost 1000 playlists with you, and if you don't listen to those who have supported you from the jump, why are you even still contributing? Just my $11.99 cents. Thanks for‚Ä¶ something Spotify. It's a big old shame. Also, Lockheed Martin? Lame and Loser behavior. Welcome to the wrong side of history! xx

bob (not bob,LOVE THIS APP!!!,"Ok I love Spotify and I prefer it over Apple Music. BUT, I do have a few things that I think need improvement. I don't have Spotify premium and I'm not saying allow certain things that you allow in premium, but things that premium also doesn't include. First, I hate how you can't search for songs in your library(or in playlists). Next, I hate how you can't play all your songs at once, like you can in Apple Music. The only reason I know this is because my family has a plan on Apple Music but I'm gonna start paying for Apple Music soon the only reason I haven't yet is bc I don't have a credit card yet(I'm 15). Lastly, and idk if this is just my phone, but sometimes when I'm on an ad, it won't let me get out of it. It won't let me look at my other playlists or search something or anything. So idk if that was intentional or not. That's all! Everything else is great and I loveeee this app! Idk what I would do without itüòÖ",5,9.0.40,2025-05-12T18:09:19-07:00,us,2025-05-15 14:30:17

Walk it off ho3,Lack of transparency,"It kinda bothers me that when i had downloaded this app again as i do every once and a while when i get offered a  deal on the subscription, i noticed that the UI that was present in first few minutes was nice and sleek more modern if you will and i liked it (aesthetically speaking) well in minutes i realized it reverted to the dull  basic UI and it was so off putting. I contacted Spotify and they told me to wait while they looked into it 3 times telling me thanks for your patience blah blah, after 15 minutes the message I received was ""we don't have any information to offer on this issue, thanks for contacting Spotify"" and they ended the chat‚Ä¶ Classic corporate runaround‚Äî""we're looking into it"" followed by radio silence and a generic brush-off. They know it's intentional (like A/B testing) but aren't allowed to admit it because it would cause backlash from users upset they're stuck with the ""ugly"" version. I never singed up for AB testing and don't know why I'm selected for it this is not the first time my UI always changes into some basic trash and I'm premium if someone is paying for the service they deserve the most updated UI why do some users get to have it and others don't?

Wertabob,Too much ads,"Yes the amount of songs in the app is crazy, however if you do not pay for premium it is an absolute nightmare to listen to music without an ad or two popping up after ONE SONG. It is so annoying, why would you make a music app if it is only going to be all ads. At this point your whole playlist just turns into a playlist of ads. Not only that, but every ad is the same there is no mix up,  yes it is annoying that after every song there is an ad, but the most annoying thing is how repetitive each one is. The only way to even enjoy listening to music is to pay for the pass. Which is so annoying because why would you market an app that is free, when the free isn't even worth it.  I am just sick of it because, I am a young person just trying to do homework, and I can't even focus with all of it. That's it, goodbye.",1,9.0.40,2025-05-11T15:33:41-07:00,us,2025-05-15 14:30:17

Abbie the Karen,HOW DARE YOU!!!,"Dear Spotify,
I hope this review finds you well. I am outraged. To say the least, you have logged me out of my account which I have had for the past 2 YEARS!! I don't understand why you would do this.  I had listened to my favourite artist Billie Eilish Pirate Baird O'Connell on that account for ages. She was my number 1 streamed artist and I had all her songs in my playlist and liked songs. I have now been forced to make a new account as I cannot remember my password for my old one and I am unable to access my old email address at the moment aswell. I have to go through all her songs, like them all again, add them all to my playlist and listen to them over and over again to get on her % of daily listeners and her to be my most streamed artist this year on Spotify wrapped. I am not happy whatsoever and i hope you are able to help me to get my account back because I miss it a lot. Thank you.

Matthew Cohman,üåñ,"It doesn't keep the songs on your playlist when you get a new phone despite having an account. The app crashes too much. A lot of times it says ""Spotify offline"" and you have to reset your playlist which doesn't always work. It will say ""you need wifi to download songs"" despite the songs already being downloaded and you're paying premium so you can use Spotify offline. Also the app is so slow. If you have your playlist on shuffle it doesn't always play all your songs and restarts from the first song in that specific shuffle. Songs keep appearing on my playlist that I haven't added to it so I have to keep restarting the playlist because it's music I'm not interested in. Sometimes it will change a version of a song you have on your playlist to a censored version of the song without you doing so. I'll be listening to my playlist at the gym. Then when I get ready for work in the morning the same exact songs will play in the same order so I don't get to listen to my whole playlist most times.",2,9.0.40,2025-05-06T04:37:40-07:00,gb,2025-05-15 14:30:17

I love Mondays for discover weekly, but find only perhaps one or two tracks that I would like to keep. Too much focus on America for me . The Algorithms could be more adventurous .  
I would love to find out how to put my library in alphabetical order. 
Thank you Spotify!",4,9.0.36,2025-05-02T00:42:40-07:00,gb,2025-05-15 14:30:17
routingtooting,replacing humans with ai,"they fired all their staff and replaced it with an ai dj. what is the point of companies and why should we support them if they're not supporting human beings? why would i have any respect for any company that wants to hoard wealth? ai is terrible for the planet, terrible for people and their livelihood and for what? so even less people can get even more money? i don't respect that company practice. they don't even pay the artists properly, so what are we actually paying for? 

years ago people were talking about how companies were important to distribute wealth and good for the people. i always knew that was a lie. 

i'm going back to ipod",1,9.0.36,2025-05-02T00:32:29-07:00,gb,2025-05-15 14:30:17
Jorwal96,The best music streaming service,"Spotify is just the best music streaming service & I've been a subscriber for over a decade, but there's a definitely room for a few improvements.

The first is the price of premium - it's expensive, but you are getting a good service.

Secondly, the AI DJ is fantastic but it would be better if you could queue up your own songs between the suggestions - if you've got the DJ playing, songs you queue up aren't actually queued & you need to start playing a specific song/playlist to get the queue functionality to work.",4,9.0.36,2025-05-02T00:28:33-07:00,gb,2025-05-15 14:30:17

VeryFemme.,Spotify's capitalist B.S.,Pros: lots of music and podcasts. Cons: the entire app is designed to try and make money off you in the most irritating ways.

Animalsarethebest üíû,what i think,"i do think spotify is rlly good for listening to music and ive been using it since 2020 or 2021 and i prefer it over any other music app. although, there is one thing that really annoys me. i mostly listen to my playlists on my phone or ipad. but, whenever i try to listen to my playlist on my phone, it doesn't play it in order and it's not on shuffle. and then, whenever i want to listen to a song, i'll search it up and then press on it which leads me to press the play button to obviously play the song. but, it doesn't even play the song. it plays random songs i don't want to listen to. on ipad, it's so simple, so easy, not complicated. you can press on a song to actually play it and you can actually listen to your playlist in order. pls fix this, spotify?",4,9.0.36,2025-04-26T11:30:35-07:00,gb,2025-05-15 14:30:17

spongebobü•àüõ∞üöÄ‚õµÔ∏è‚õµÔ∏è,If there were free alternatives I would switch,"Spotify has to be one of the most annoying to use streaming platforms to use, practically unusable without premium on mobile. The only reason I didn't give it one star is because I will continue to use it, however not buy premium as it is overpriced. The thing that annoys me the most about  using Spotify on mobile with no premium is that I could want to listen to one song specifically, and I'll search for it, click on it to be met with some random song. Bear in mind you only get 6 skips an hour, so you may not even get to listen to the song you wanted to if it takes more than 6 skips to finally listen to it. It's also annoying that you can't go back to the previous song or any timeframe within the song itself.",2,9.0.36,2025-04-25T12:49:55-07:00,gb,2025-05-15 14:30:17

#-Berna,Scrap streaming,Everything has been added to the Premium version and the free version cannot be navigated therefore jumping onto songs I don't wanna hear. And it is a rip off   as I don't wanna boots anyone's bank account whom I don't wanna listen. Also not going to pay for premium either as not worth it. I only listen to those songs I currently hadn't purchased yet. I purchase everything so I can listen to them anytime I want without ads.,1,9.0.36,2025-04-25T06:05:16-07:00,gb,2025-05-15 14:30:17

its amazingly amazing!,good !!,"i really like spotify and always listen to my playlists whenevr i'm bored, but there's a few things i would change .

#1: when i listen to a playlist for too long, it starts playing random songs that aren't even on my playlist? i have tried googling it and switching it off on settings, but it still happens. pleaseee fix it ‚òπÔ∏è

#2: when you don't have spotify premium, i get you are meant to have ads but seriously there's like three 30 second ones in a row and then it says ""30 minutes of uninterrupted listening"" and then gives you 3 more like 5 minutes later, it's really annoying . 

#3: i don't know if they still do this, but when you don't have spotify premium you have a limit on seeing the lyrics per MONTH??? having a limit on seeing the lyrics is a bad idea anyways, but per month is just crazy üò≠ 

#4: it often lags, like my app is updated and i have full bars but sometimes when i click on spotify it just kicks me off and wont let me on the app. i dunno why it's doing this, i've googled it many times but it's not my phone that's the problem sooo ü§®‚Ä¶..

anyways, apart from that the app is really good! i spend hours listening to music every day and i am literally addicted to it ü´°

Mico helps your home page,Spotify is actually so unusable,I literally have a playlist with the same song for like 90 and they never play the song but random songs and the six skips per hour is actually so annoying like just play the song that is in the playlist or just let me to play the song on repeat. And the amount of ads are so annoying like every one song it's feel like 50 ads are on and they are so long for no apparent reason this why i use a different app while listening to music through my headphones. Like I only use Spotify when I'm cleaning the kitchen or when I don't get ads,2,9.0.32,2025-04-22T09:44:10-07:00,gb,2025-05-15 14:30:17

Fatkid!,Great!,"Great! Thanks. Really enjoying hearing some of the old music I knew and either have, lost or missed over the years. Equally, I loving some of the old and fresh music I am now discovering and would probably have never heard. Spotify has also been great to refresh or familiarise myself of artists I am about to see at festivals, or make playlists of setlists of artists seen live.

Im just being honest1234,It's really good but‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.,It's really good but i think you could have a bit more videos like there will still be songs but some more videos like ticktock or stufff anywho next problem like i think there should be a button to just select songs in you playlist and the press like delete all '37' songs or so because i hate going thru my playlist and deleting them 1 by 1 and cou;d their be a button that lets u delete all songs in ur favorites so u can start again because lots of the songs in my playlist are cringey and I dont want to have to delete all of them 1 by 1 ALSO IF WE BUY PREMIUM LET US HAVE PREMEUIM FOREVER UNTIL OUR ACCOUNT EXPIRES BUT THAT DOESNT MEAN YOU SHOULD MAKE OUR ACCOINTS EXPIRE SOONER!!!!
