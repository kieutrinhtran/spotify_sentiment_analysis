8,DontaBuya,"The only way to not be plagued with multiple advertisements between every song you listen to is paying for the premium version. This wouldn't be an issue if it were a few ads every once and awhile right? Wrong. If you have Spotify free for whatever reason, you will hear no less than 4 ads after every song. You will hear more advertisements then actual music. When your ""Spotify wrapped"" comes out in November, it should actually show; 1. Draft Kings, 2.

13,Joey @sassygamergirl,"Ok so my friend doesn't have premium and I do and not having premium can be ultra annoying. First every like 5 or 6 songs there is an ad and it gets to be annoying. Next, you can't just pick a so g to play. You have to pick a playlist and a random song plays. I personally think you should be able to pick whatever song you choose. Lastly, premium is just way better than non premium and I think you should add some options to non premium that just aren't fair to have them on premium but not have them on non premium. These are the things. Number 1, non premium members should be able to pick whatever song they please. Number 2, adds you get in between songs, the number of songs in between each ad is ALWAYS randomized. Sometimes it is 8 songs or 2 or 5 etc. make it a specific number like 5 or 10. This is my review.

14,Rpgalltheway,"Spotify knows they keep making their product worse and worse, they have to know, they get bombarded with suggestions and requests because heavens forbid any tech company actually field real support and feedback, let's just leave it up to blogs and forums and let the consumers do the thinking for us. It seems Spotify has fully embraced the asinine trends of terrible US tech companies like Meta and Amazon.

I was finally prompted to actually write a review because of the most recent display update that added the annoying create button in the spot where Library used to be. Library is the primary screen most people use, and now the screen real estate is messed up for what reason? To put all the social features in one inconvenient place? I never have and never will want to use any of the create tools, and guess what they were all fine exactly where they were, never had any trouble finding them before. 

I also don't want to keep paying an increased subscription price for an app that can't load downloaded content correctly when the network is congested. There doesn't seem to be the common sense feature that if network speeds do not meet a certain threshold then toggle offline mode so people can still access offline content appropriately. Instead of having a bloated app that consumes too many resources that essentially crashes when the network speeds are good enough to navigate everything on the app but not good enough stream, making it so you still somehow can't access downloaded content because streaming can't happen and offline mode has to be toggled on to access it.

I also don't want to pay for audiobooks I never listen to, if you're trying to poach Audible subscribers the answer was to not subsidize the feature by making it seem like a beneficial extra to the base subscription and then upping the price. Make a music+audiobook subscription tier and have it cost $2 more than the base premium. Same with the new video hosting, I don't want to pay for Spotify's new video hosting servers, I want a dedicated quality music app and now the vision is clearly gone.

The only people that want what Spotify is currently doing are the executives that can get more money from even the worst ideas (because somehow even terribly implemented features = increased subscription price) and the people who believe them when they get told these are all good things. The amount of good ideas and feature requests and feature removal requests (looking at you smart shuffle) completely ignored on the forums exemplify that Spotify clearly does not care. 

All these features should be opt-in/toggle-able at the very least, and removed immediately for others.

This is a great time to start supporting artists directly, purchasing tracks so you can have them forever, and not rely on companies that make things consistently worse to dictate your experiences.",spotify knows keep making product worse worse know get bombarded suggestions requests heavens forbid tech company actually field real support feedback let leave blogs forums let consumers thinking us seems spotify fully embraced asinine trends terrible us tech companies like meta amazon finally prompted actually write review recent display update added annoying create button spot library used library primary screen people use screen real estate messed reason put social features one inconvenient place never never want use create tools guess fine exactly never trouble finding also want keep paying increased subscription price app load downloaded content correctly network congested seem common sense feature network speeds meet certain threshold toggle offline mode people still access offline content appropriately instead bloated app consumes many resources essentially crashes network speeds good enough navigate everything app good enough stream making still somehow access downloaded content streaming happen offline mode toggled access also want pay audiobooks never listen trying poach audible subscribers answer subsidize feature making seem like beneficial extra base subscription upping price make music audiobook subscription tier cost base premium new video hosting want pay spotify new video hosting servers want dedicated quality music app vision clearly gone people want spotify currently executives get money even worst ideas somehow even terribly implemented features increased subscription price people believe get told good things amount good ideas feature requests feature removal requests looking smart shuffle completely ignored forums exemplify spotify clearly care features opt toggle able least removed immediately others great time start supporting artists directly purchasing tracks forever rely companies make things consistently worse dictate experiences,1,9.0.40,2025-05-13T17:50:37-07:00,2025-05-15 22:48:04,apple_store

130,Poignant Bubble,"Spotify, 

Next month, I will be walking away after 10 years with Spotify, because of poor choice after poor choice made by the Spotify team. Since having premium, i haven't listened to ads in 5 years, and after reading recent reviews it seems that those of us who have Free receive more ads than music. The whole ""30 minutes of ad free music"" followed by an ad 5 minutes later was happening 5 years ago too by the way. For one of the top two music apps in the world, with millions of users, you might think that the ads given would be justifiably less intrusive than they have to be, but Spotify has proven to be much more about profit than user experience. In the last year, i have noticed at least 7 major changes to the app interface, none of which has made my experience as a customer any easier. My humble onion, it started going downhill when you changed your font last year. As a long time user, of course i noticed. it bothered me, but it wasn't too much to bear. Fast forward to now, and i've even noticed a bug on the screen when opening the new ""add"" feature. Beloved Spotify employees. Why fix what ain't broke? Why make such bad choices when apple music pays artists more, and doesn't change UI that's been the same for 10+ years? Not everything needs an update, especially when people have been asking for you to bring back dated playlists and different 'sort by' options. I never, ever thought i'd change sides after going through ""Spotify vs Apple Music"" in HS. I always thought Spotify was superior, and I was wrong. I consider myself to be an A+ Spotify user, with 10 years and almost 1000 playlists with you, and if you don't listen to those who have supported you from the jump, why are you even still contributing? Just my $11.99 cents. Thanks for‚Ä¶ something Spotify. It's a big old shame. Also, Lockheed Martin? Lame and Loser behavior. Welcome to the wrong side of history! xx 

Sincerely, 
Disappointed.",spotify next month walking away years spotify poor choice poor choice made spotify team since premium listened ads years reading recent reviews seems us free receive ads music whole minutes ad free music followed ad minutes later happening years ago way one top two music apps world millions users might think ads given would justifiably less intrusive spotify proven much profit user experience last year noticed least major changes app interface none made experience customer easier humble onion started going downhill changed font last year long time user course noticed bothered much bear fast forward even noticed bug screen opening new add feature beloved spotify employees fix broke make bad choices apple music pays artists change ui years everything needs update especially people asking bring back dated playlists different sort options never ever thought change sides going spotify vs apple music hs always thought spotify superior wrong consider spotify user years almost playlists listen supported jump even still contributing cents thanks something spotify big old shame also lockheed martin lame loser behavior welcome wrong side history xx sincerely disappointed,1,9.0.40,2025-05-13T00:37:31-07:00,2025-05-15 22:48:04,apple_store

It is so annoying, why would you make a music app if it is only going to be all ads. At this point your whole playlist just turns into a playlist of ads. Not only that, but every ad is the same there is no mix up,  yes it is annoying that after every song there is an ad, but the most annoying thing is how repetitive each one is. The only way to even enjoy listening to music is to pay for the pass. Which is so annoying because why would you market an app that is free, when the free isn't even worth it.

I love it overall, but too many ads and pressure to take premium and the choice of selecting our songs to hear or skip to next song etc...these basic features are removed if the premium features are used for anything other than these basic features it will be good and feasible to all the app users other than that there's no problem with the app. It's amazing as it is",app designs features amazing incredible sound quality love overall many ads pressure take premium choice selecting songs hear skip next song etc basic features removed premium features used anything basic features good feasible app users problem app amazing,4,8.9.96.476,2024-12-04 08:07:45,2025-05-15 22:47:25,google_play
995,Sophia Madsen,"I only have 1 issue with this app, and it's that you can only view a certain amount of lyrics unless you have Spotify premium. I have premium now, but when I didn't, it was really annoying not being able to view the lyrics. Other than that It's a pretty good app. One suggestion is maybe make it so you can turn on notifications for specific artists so you can get notified when they release a new album or song.",issue app view certain amount lyrics unless spotify premium premium really annoying able view lyrics pretty good app one suggestion maybe make turn notifications specific artists get notified release new album song,5,9.0.16.572,2025-02-13 11:40:37,2025-05-15 22:47:25,google_play

997,Eli Kirshenbaum,"I swear i used to be able to search on the watch app, tho maybe it was only on the old Tizen Samsung watches. But if it worked there I see no reason not to have search on WearOS too. I should NOT have had to pull up the YouTube website on my watch to choose a song when I left my phone at home. Other than this it's a great app, I love the layout and it works well for the limited function, but search is such a dealbreaker that it can bring an otherwise 5-star review down to only 2.",swear used able search watch app tho maybe old tizen samsung watches worked see reason search wearos pull youtube website watch choose song left phone home great app love layout works well limited function search dealbreaker bring otherwise star review,2,8.9.94.470,2024-11-26 20:06:06,2025-05-15 22:47:25,google_play
